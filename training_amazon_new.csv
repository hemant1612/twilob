Processor is so bad.and not working properly.so please note this point.otherwise redmi 5a processor is so good	1
Don't buy this product. It is not recognizing the second Sim. Its a different and a saperate slot for 2nd sim unlike the other phones  and the phone is not recognizing the 2nd slot. It's better if both the SIM cards are placed in single slot.  Battery backup is very low, you will need to charge twice daily.	1
Too slow go for reminder 5a it's far better than 6a hanging issue	1
Totally a waste product ... Poor Touch screen ...  Hanging several times. Amazon team is also not responding on my new device....10 days returns policy is just a foolish term at all.	1
Phone is very slow & hanging also. Failed in mi model. Pls don't buy it. Go to another model.	1
I bought 6a only 1 day ago..battery is too poor.8 hours hold it mobile in 2g network last night data off no other application on..automatically 18 percent down battery.	1
I am disappointed. I rcvd a faulty charger which is not working. This is cheating and I will NVR recommend anyone to buy this product. PLS HELP REPLACE CHARGER	1
Everything in this phone is good. But I got a faulty phone. The proximity sensor is not working. The Amazon service providers continuously told me lie regarding replacement and return. And now I m just to break the phone. Their lies was highly humiliating.	1
Mobile is not loaded with anything , but feel like hanging all time .. I guess UI OR software problem	1
Hanging at the intial stage without any apps downloaded and worst response from Amazon.  Proximity sensor not working	1
battery drains from 90% to 5% in 2 hours even if the phone is idle and data swiched off. the problem is with this phone only other wise MI phones have the best battery. Seems like i got a defective item	1
very bad camera	1
The speaker is not working properly.  Whenever anyone calls me I can not hear his/her voice clearly. I wanted a replacement but they denied that.	1
Its Only 12days of using this Device and it is not able to get charge. really unhappy with this product. This is the first bad experience for me from amazon.	1
I bought mobile Redmi 6A not more than a week. Battery life is not good. Even without any usage, battery drains automatically.	1

My expectations were huge when i ordered the Redmi 6A. But when i got the product it was a defective one. The second slim slot was not accepting SIM. I Initiated the return and it was very fast, good service by amazon. But still quality checks of products should be done accurately to avoid such issues.	1
Don't waste your money, the processor is supper slow and will take ages to load. Waste of Money!!! Nice experiment in budgeted category by REDMI; however, it has broken the trust I had :(	1
Called to return this device but the only replace it but I can't get a refund. Don't buy this phone if you need decent speed. This phone is too slow and camera quality is so cheap for 6000. 3500 would justify the money.	1
I recieved the mobile after 5days. The mediatek processor is very slow while opening the apps it takes ages to open while battery is disgusting while compring 6a to 5a is far better. 5a contains sd425 is far better while opening the youtube it takes time to open while at th booting it takes to restart the phone. It is worst exprience with phone.	1

Bhai sound quality down & battery backup is very low this phone is bad response for me & I suggest to you don't buy this phone	1
This smartphone has a hardware issue. It's second sim slot is not working. I am sure that I  have only got the defective product or not. I opted for replacement. I do not expect a smartphone manufacturer such as Xiaomi which has poor quality checkup standards. I am hoping to get working smart after replacement.	1
The phone is too slow. Please don't go for this. Despite of having 2GB RAM, Phone lags too much. And you will get unnecessary ads by Xiaomi. Which gets really annoying sometimes.	1
Worst	1
Happy	1
Bill is not with us	1
The phone which I purchased through amazon is a worst, I cannot trust amazon anymore, I purchased Redmi 6A on 12th of Nov. I own the phone tried using it, since its a dual sim, I inserted my two sim, n tried using,the second sim was not detectable, I took out again n tried inserting again,the same thing was showing on, I took the new phone to a mobile shop to show it, den the shopkeeper said the motherboard is not good, so funny the new phone which I purchased was from amazon redmi 6A,is not a good phone, I have kept the phone to change the mother board..worst experience ever...	1
Very bad phone please don't buy any one I use it for a month and it not working properly it hanged at any instant.	1

During the call without headset, the display is not getting off so that, it resulting to adding another call and sometime hold the current calls without knowledge. While speaking the display should off to avoid such issues where proximity sensor is not functioning in the mobile, when check with customer care they are asking to format all the data's and handover the mobile to them for software update..., very much disappointed.., why cant we should have update directly from MI	1

Worst product worst customer service in warranty period	1
Whatever this phone might have been capable of has been completely ruined by the software on this phone and despite almost everybody calling it out to micromax, there is no hint of any improvement regarding the same. After almost an year using this phone, I would not recommend this or any other micromax phone for that matter. To what extent do we settle with this company for the sake of patriotism, atleast the Chinese are working hard and competing with apple, and here is micromax only interested in churning in money by reselling the fruit of Chinese hardwork. Great example of pathetic leadership and certainly not a company that shows any patriotism or deserves the patriotic support shown by Indians towards this company !	1
This is a really worst phone .This phone is arise ao many software problems .Like hanging,slow working apps..Touch will be loose with in a short period of time ..And lack of servicing centers ...Even small crash on phone also this phone unworthy for warranty ... Software update kavalante 300/-.at services centre.,such a big mistake in my daily usage..So plz beware of this phone	1
Not at all a good phone ... Battery lags and the performance is also not up to the mark. Biggest mistake that I bought it.	1
low volume cant speak on this phone unless we use headphone even for incoming calls bell doesnt ring shown to many service stations.... no luck	1
Phone is good. But In this one year, there is No security updates, no bug fixes updates and no Oreo update from Micromax. Worst customer service centre. During the initial release they promised about Oreo update. But even they not providing proper security updates and bug fixes updates.	1

"The touch sensitivity of this phone is totally flawed. You cannot disconnect calls at times. You can'y answer calls at time. Try using the calculator. At times you press on any number, sign ... only ""x"" sign comes. I have used Micromax before and never experienced such discomfort with any of their phones. This one is really not a phone I would recommend to anyone."	1
This handset have hanging problem please don't buy this	1
I was under a very good opinion about Micromax  mobile phones. But it's very  unfortunate that the efficiency of the mobile which I have received is very very very poor. I want to exchange - but I have received it exactly a month back i.e., 22.09.2017. can I go for exchange or return of this product please.....?	1
Phone looks gud only in outward appearance. Call quality (the basic function of a mobile) not gud. Inaudible and mumbled voice output on earphones. Tried different earphones but result always same. Front camera quality okay but main camera poor quality which is even worsen by poor quality display. Don't go for it coz better phones available in this range. Even one year old Lenovo k6 is working better than this. Buttons on display not as gud in operation as advertised.	1
HORRIBLE PHONE...THE PHONE IS DEAD IN JUST 3 MONTHS.CUSTOMER CARE IS HORRIBLE.MICROMAX COMPANY MUST BE BANNED.ITS A FRAUD COMPANY.	1
I suggest to not buy because of heating problem and speaker and also screen colour was bad effect	1

Very very poor product and services by Amazon. After getting this mobile from Amazon I phase some technical issue that when mobile is restart, the mobile network not detect automatically in first time and for getting mobile network we have to restart is several time. Also phase a problem in last two days (from 23/12/2017) when any call comes in my cell the display automatically getting dark and nothing display as well as I am unable to pick call. For this I go on factory reset option but problems still happens.	1
Don't buy this phone. Two major issues that I face : If you move from wifi data to sim data (VoLTE) you wont be able to make voice calls. In that case you have to either restart your phone or reactivate your sim. I face this issue on a daily basis. Horrible experience. Many a times touch screen just stops working.	1
This is the worst phone.I had bought this phone using no cost emi. Firstly i had replace due to technical issues. Second time I had got refund due to the same issue.  For this issues i have paid 1 month interest.	1
Very bad for use. Hanging problem. Networking problem, internet connectivity problems.	1
Worst product. Within two days started auto shutdown and dead mode only the red led indicator at top right side. Referred to care centre but no use, finally sold with scrap value.	1
Phone not working properly.  It's nott been even 1 month their is mang problems in the phone. Worst product . Amazon please refund amd take your product.	1
Lot of hang issue, inbuilt email not found, inbuilt browser not found, inbuilt document viewer not found, lot of videos not support and more huge problem.	1

Though MICROMAX IS A INDIAN company but it's  @@@NOT MADE IN INDIA@@@....WHEN I RECEIVED MY PHONE ON THE BOX IT IS MENTIONED AS @@@@MADE IN CHINA@@@ which is ridiculous. If I would have known that I'm getting a made in CHINA phone then I would have opted for CHINESE company phones only... after seeing this label MADE IN CHINA. I even went to sell this phone  but no one was ready to buy it  coz redmi is available for them at 7K only. I expected  this mobile to be MADE IN INDIA & not made in elsewhere. 1.Sometimes phone is acting weird(hanging) unable to operate anything need to restart phone in order to use the phone, now a days it's becoming a regular task. 2. Unable to pickup incoming calls also at times, even today I have faced this problem. 3. All of a sudden some apps stop working. Hope these comments would have some impact on the maker of the phone.	1
Amazon ..... About phone : - Camera is good Battery is ok Display is ok Sound is normal Hanging problem is there ... Touch id working 2 times out 10 attemps ... And the big problem is no customer support...n Micromax claim 24*7 service ....I reported complaint 7 days ago but there is no revert from company ...I'm very upset with company ....I'm giving one star bcoz of camera otherwise  zero my side to this product n company	1
I am sharing this review, after using for around 6 months . First look of this phone is very impressive , after using this for around 6 months , I am facing lot of issues. First thing that it became very slow , and hangs very often. Sometimes I don't see calling screen to receive call, but phone will ring . Mic of phone fas stopped working. I am shouting from my side, other side person is not able to hear. I am using earphone all the time. Service centre guys are literally stupid. My phone is under the garuntee period they are adding extra cost of every thing. It's my last mobile from Micromax. I would recommend don't go with this product atleast.	1
Don't buy this phone Always get hang. This is the reason the battery is removable	1

Both  camera  poor  quality  and  battery not  ok  and  not  3g ram and  normal  quality  mobile...	1
Display touch not work properly. This products don't more Run & Selling in market because Indian company Micromax has don't provide Quality. No.1 poor display touch. This is most important.	1
Don't buy.  not worth for money !  Waste of money ! We think that this is an Indian brand so we need to encourage it ! But when it doesn't work properly what us the use of buying ?	1

I bought it on 19Sep. All is good except an issue that even my Lift to wake is off, it is gettimg on whenever I pock my phone. This creates lot of issues when I kept my mobile at pocket or when I am in call. Screen automatically gets switched on and mute/end call gets pressed. Amy big fixes?!	2
Good product but processer is not good as Qualcomm processer.	2
I am using this mobile since one week so I found so many lags while using youTube, camera, and also battery is draining very fast. The phone look good outside but its is very pure at performance. Please look at alternate mobiles at this price rage.	2
Its taking around 15 minutes for an app to get installed after downloading.. No issue with the internet connectivity..	2
i am not taken this product delivery boy asked me about opt which is sent on my number and i want cancle this product ,waiting for great indian festival that is from 10th oct to 14 oct	2

It is one of the best Redmi 6A	2
Battery life weak	2
Hii	2
Average	2
Super	2
YouTube and other videos are very dull... It's not worth 6000/-.	2
Its slightly slow,2gb ram is not sufficient. you get only 8gb out of 16 gb. sound quality is not good. Display is decent because it is not fhd only hd+. Can't say about battery backup, i will update later. 5k is enough for this phone, Redmi is looting 1k/ phone because of it's brand value in India. Look is not so much attractive. You can get more better phone in this price range.	2
Pro:- A big screen. Cons:- 1.Bad sound quality. 2.Hangs while using YouTube. 3.Hangs using apps simultaneously. 4.Cameras 13MP/5MP works mysteriously low as compared to other phones of same specs. 5. The processor sucks. 6. You only get 8GB storage. The phone shouldn't have costed more than 5000. Seems xaomi will end up very soon.	2
"Fantastic product in terms of body, looks, battery etc. The part which misses the rating is the buggy software which brings the hardware to life. Its the security bug which locks repeatedly though you enter correct pin or pattern; especially more observed when dual space is enabled. Mi website also lists the issue in so many threads. Go for a Google search of ""Phone Has been locked, Try Again in 119 minutes"" and verify yourself. Its all about the bug in several of the mi product, and personally faced many times. Imagine you have to call a Uber  or Ola cab to catch a flight and you get the message. Other issue is heating, which is prominent in hot weather. Be careful if you are in Delhi or Gujarat during summer.  Otherwise phone is good in this budget."	2
Touch design very bad	2
Bad ph below 7000 quality is not ok. We suggest never purchase this product at this rate can buy any other phone	2
Sensor not working even in new phone.	2

Not good.	2
"Was glad to see made in India label inside the phone. But when I saw the charger it said ""made in china"". Still OK. Now I thought of charging the phone a bit.. just 5 minutes after setting the new phone. As soon as I connected the charger to the socket, there was a spark and shot circuit in the charger, phone was not connected. So go disappointed. I am not returning this phone as I have already gifted it. Not sure if Amazon seller would be able to send replacement for the charger alone. Amazon never replaced the product even after multiple conversations.."	2
Highly NOT RECOMMENDED While ordering I was like I'm ordering Indian make handset with patriotic feeling and expected the unexpected :( Pathetic phone, received defected peice, got it exchanged after so much hassle, again received faulty handset. If someone calls me other person can't hear me properly. They think I've put the on speaker and speaking from other room with phone in other room. So awful.	2
Got this phone delivered on 15th aug, using it for more than 15 hours now. Facing problem with battery drainage, it reduces like 20% with normal usage in less than an hour. By normal usage I mean even updating the contact details as it is new phone. Also when the phone is not in use i.e on standby it reduces 5-7% in an hours time. So 20% drainage in 1hr is really bad. Hence applying for Return.	2
Phone was average but unfortunately it stopped working after 7 months and .. service is even worst I am still waiting for serviced return... my advice never go for any micromax product.. better to buy Chinese at least no service expectations....	2
Do not take this phone within two months i have to visit gallery 3 times sometimes it doesn't support charging n than i have to replace my screen n the service centre also don't do their work properly	2
the phone hangs too much, even it is no where available to exchange it. seriously crying	2
It's hanging again and again so please think about this product before buying and if you want call to some one it shows on call but phone will show on call and hanging	2

Camera quality is not up to the mark. it has no quality like 16mp, Selfie camera is also very poor.	2

I bought this one a month ago.. There are soo many issues with this mobile,when you tries to call someone,mobile screen automatically gets locked and its not at all responding till we disconnects the call.. Only Battery backup is good.I thought that i will get the best mobile,But i didn't. Very disappointed.	2
It's good phone but while playing music continues for 2hrs it start heating . That's why i am not happy with this product & when we take pic from normal camera and when i zoom that pic the pic starts getting blur & when we take pic while zooming the pic is not clear.	2
This device was no doubt had best specifications with low price but after using it for two months I am dissatisfied with it. Camera is not at all good. Lenovo/LG provide better camera. The software is not tested thoroughly it automatically scrolls up/down while searching for photo or contact and many more it not at all upto the mark.	2
there is always an issue with the 2nd sim slot .... the sim card tower is seldom available. but when put in a different cell the sim card functions well. The battery takes more than 3 hours to recharge.	2
One of wrost phone in my purchase life nothing good with this hanging,heating,battary everything wrost now I came why Micromax lost his place	2

Micromax canvas infinity... After using for 3 months really disappointed with device, it's gone hang up when mobile data started sim contacts always loading, battery backup is not good as mentioned. Call receiving problem...	2
Initially phone was working fine. But with in week started creating heating issues and also calling feature is not smooth, when we try calling or receive a call screen gets locked and black.  we are not able to disconnect or pick up call. Not able to perform any action once a call is dialled. Seems my money got wasted.	2

Not up to the mark Less battery life And old processor Better go with MI which have same price but performance and battery life is better than this.	2
4 stars for the looks. 1 star for the lag. 1 star for the after sales	2
Heating issues and battery drain out .	2
I want to exchange my micromax infinity but it is not showing....	2
Battery was bad	2
here's an honest review .. two stars only coz of laggy UI and amazon's return policy .. phone over all is okay not that bad .. camera and screen and other stuff is fine.. whats not fine is its keep getting crashed and lags alot like hell.. as for the phone i would add more cash and buy a different and better phone with more ram and strong processor... i requested for my refund but amazon is only providing replacement ..means same device with same lagging issues and dumb UI .. i hope i get my money back  and get a new phone.	2
Guys, this phone has network issues.. It is not able to detect sims, Many of my friends also faced the issue and we've returned the device. We've confirmed the same by inserting the same sim in different phones and they're working fine. Just think about this before buying	2
Over heating while charging. Battery draining constantly.It wont accept 3G or 2G SIMs.	2
Not worth. No infinity screen. No value for money. Battery backup very bad. Hanging issue.	2
software is not good. when connected with internet for few second it not respond to unlock.	2
Its showing touchscreen problem on my item.	2
Nice and so beautiful but it is not working properly	2
Product is good, but battery backup is not up to the mark. Good in style and looks. Finger touch is also a bit slow	2
Good product but there are better products in market. Won't recommend to buy. Feel sorry for spending 10k on this product.	2
It's not a good product some time hanging softwere lagging	2
Bad phone hanging phone	2
Not actually	2
Pure feel of sub-standard product..	2
"Update: ""Possibly the worst phone I have ever bought. It keeps installing software by itself. Can't turn off this app centre which keeps sending notifications and installing all kinds of apps. So irritating."" Processor is not the best, notice some heavy apps are little slow, but general day to day performance is good. Does the job. Camera is pretty impressive for the price. Software portrait mode works sometimes, sometimes not. Need good lighting for it. When it works its nice. Is there on front and back cameras. Lightweight. Good screen. Only 720p but 18:9 is sweet. Battery is quite good. I get 5.5 hours SoT every time. Better processor would have been killer but overall very happy at this price."	2
After 2 months it started hanging	2
The cameras both front and rear are a huge disappointment as compared to redmi 4 and redmi 5a. I fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. Portrait mode doesn't work properly either. I don't expect the camera of S8 or iPhone in 6000 but other phones in the same price range certainly have better to offer. Other features work well but I was really let down with the camera this time.	3
Yes price is very low for this phone also it's performance,  after using for a week phone start to hang whenever you used 2 or more apps together and battery is also a issue I have to charge it two times in a day it drains quickly. First I give it 5 star but after using it I change it for 3	3
Pros: 1) Decent Video/audio recording with minimum distortion.   (noise cancellation is much much better than Redmi 5a)   2) Decent Camera for a budget phone.   3) good for Android smartphone beginners.   4) Can run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging.   5) Fast boot.   6) Good touch response for a budget phone,  I find it to extra sensitive. haha Cons: 1) Bad Video quality for watching movies/ you tube. But I use phone only for whatsapp and sometimes Instagram. I use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me.   2) Unable to share Internet hotspot to computer/Laptop. But I posted a tip on how to solve this problem in MI community India. All you need to do is download an app called PDANet+ (available in Google play store) in both your phone and computer. Go and check it out.   Apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. If you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. The 1440X720 resolution is much worse compared to Redmi 5a's 1280X720. In fact Redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to Redmi 6a.	3
Cons:   Build quality is OK as per price. Camera and Sound is average as expected at this price.  draining fast even on wifi (merely 7 to 8 hours of normal usage) on new battery. Some normal games lag a bit. Face lock doesnot work all the time (works nearly 70%). It is very irritating to have UI full of too many advertisement. Also the phone has too many bloatware preinstalled (can not be uninstalled). In my case I was getting problem with Proximity Sensor (So I returned it) Pros:   Phone dialler (built in) is awesome and it supports 2 volte enable sim at the same time. One can browse from Sim 1 and make call from Sim 2. It is as it was told.  Charging time is Ok. We can use Video Call directly from phone dialler. One can use Two Sim Card and One Memory Card at a time. Screen is awesome.	3
The worst thing on all mi phone is the gyroscopic sensor doesn't work,and personally after 3wk uses of mi6A , battery drain so quickly,face unlock never work properly even you can unlock the phone faster in pattern,better to invest more and go other good brand.	3
I purchased this mobile on lightning deal. After using few days and updating that Battery life is very worst. Charge is staying for only 4-5 hrs after fully charged even if it is ideal. still i am using only one SIM. if I use dual then not able to imagine the battery life. I guess, Amazon have cheated by offering this kind of deal.	3
Internet is very slow, I think, its not 2 GB RAM, It is a 512 MB RAM, other features is good.	3
Average product. Go 4 mi 6. Additional 2000 RS but you will get 3 GB RAM, dual camera and finger print sensor.	3
Not as good as Redmi 5A	3
The sound quality is just okk, low volume speaker make hardly audible tone in crowd. Battery is decent with medium usage last for half a day. Screen is not so impressive even it doesn't seems to be 720p display.	3
Excellent Mobile, the look of it is awesome. Metallic body is strong and sturdy. The OS performance is extremely good..	3
Average mobile in this range but i missing finger unlock feature.	3
Over all the phone is good but better if quality is increased more like on sound,camera also heating issue is there but can be used	3
A good phone in this budget but the screen qlty is not upto the mark need to tap twice on any Icon then it's working . Camera is superb. Else overall the @ 6000 best phone.	3
Nice phone in this amount but the phone is very poor performance. Its work too slowly. Also Battery quality is not Better. Good face unlock system and quite faster.	3
Average rating, battery backup is average, camera average, always performance is average	3
Screen is dull while using youtube video. Sound not loud as i want. Fase unlock is ok beacause it can unlock by HD pic I have tried with 22mp image.	3
Gift card cupon code is invalid.... it's so bad.... if you can't give valid coupons stop making costumers believe that you care for us	3
Not very good ..mi 5a better than this phone.. slow pH..but also not very bad..	3
Don't purchase it's average one better go to real me mobiles	3
Battery backup not so good, take more time in charging, Some time hang problem lookwise best	3
But hangs in between or strucks while a usagewith performance	3
Speaker volume not good also miui 10 is not updated properly.	3

hi	3
Nice Budget phone. Screen quality - HD+ Storage - Not up to mark, can expect so better to use SD cards. Dedicated SD card slot is good. Camera is as usual as other redmi phone have. This phone is not for those who like to play game in mobile. Overall 7 out of 10	3
Redmi 6a comes with classy look & light in wiight. Camera quality is moderate, comes with lot of installed apps which result 8.44gb vacant space. This mobile is not for those who use social media or heavy usage app bcz it start hanging at very early use. Acc to me..redmi 5a is much better than 6a.	3
Sound is not that much good	3
I was using redmi 5a which is really great .I have purchased it because i want dual volte at lower price but at this time redmi disappointed me because it has no fingerprint again and also IR BLASTER missing which is in redmi 5a .helio p22 is not so good as i tried to run pubgm in low graphics settings but it still hangs and i m not satisfied with camera quality as it's exposure is not good compared to redmi 5a otherwise it is same as redmi 5a .i have purchased it only due to dual volte	3
One day delivery was awesome. Storage available for usage is only around 8gb. Need to buy memory card. Price should be between 5 and 5.5k only. Not worth 6k. Feedback about battery and performance I will update after usage only.	3
Phone is good but video quality is not good ..when you see  YouTube ,Facebook video is not perfect play ..poor quality seen	3
got the phone at 9am, Looks good in hand, But disappointed only 7.83 GB Available out of 16 GB Which is very less, face unlock works Good, tried with photo not unlocked, But i took my photo in my friend's vivo 20mp camera and tried unlocked many times, this is very sad i am using PIN now, display under  sunlight OK with full brightness, Camera pictures good, bot front and rear, price should be 5000, not 6000 Redmi made name and looting now. will update about battery and performance after two days,	3
Speed is slowwwwww. Slippery Build quality not good. Call quality ok. Camera, Battery Ok. Spend 2k more and go for REAL ME 2. I am not a extreme user of mobile still i feel sluggish. Processor is not good i feel. Before buy, check multiple you tube videos. Don't get exited with flash sales. Will update the review after one week of usage.	3
Youtube app video dont play a good picture quality...rest all well in this price range	3
Not a great phone but cannot expect more than anything for this price. Poor camera quality and battery life is also not good. We cannot take the pics at night and this will work at day time some extent. Sound quality is not bad but not up to the marak. Screen resolution is not good.If someone is looking for Android phone for calling purpose go for it. For other purpose like gaming and watching videos and browsing choose other good RAM phone.

The product is very good but the battery life and the processor is very poor if you have a low budget and you want to buy something very normal or good thing so this is so this product is very perfect for that requirement the camera quality is awesome but the vibration is not very good and the xiaomi keyboard is a very bad whenever I use Google keyboard Sonic keyboard replace it on Google so that's a bad thing about I see in this phone and yesterday I buy this phone and the day after tomorrow the phone is not working properly is this display is not working well so finally I restart and reboot and wipe all the data from this phone and then its fun working properly and charger cable is very the data cable is very low very small	3
hi	3
I m using this mobile from last 1 weeks. Few problems are like : 1. Face recognition is very slow, not up to the mark. 2. Phone was hang few time. Not very much satisfied with this.	3
mst phone h	3
I am not fully happy with the phone it  helps me in many ways. i can install many apps and mange my works by phone. Battery is decent but not for full one day usage. Camera is not that great, Picture quality is average. The positive thing is RAM for multiple apps	3
Calling sensor is very bad working	3
Red 6A screen quality less bettary so good not bad remaing good	3
Xiaomi has completely messed up the redmi 6 series with mediatek chipsets. I am a big fan of xiaomi and used to recommend xiaomi phones for all right from redmi note 3 times but Xiaomi isn't good these days. Mediatek chipset seems better only on paper, in real world performance even 1.5 yr old redmi 4A can easily beat it. Though rear camera quality has improved , selfie camera performance is disappointing. Battery life is no way close to the Redmi 4A or 5A. And the ram management,real world performance feels completely worst . Worst xiaomi phone ever. Now the under 7k market is filled with better devices like powerful Realme c1 , feature rich lenovo A5 and snappy Asus max lite so be wise to choose a good phone.Even redmi 5A is far better choice than this. Wish things get improved with Miui updates.	3
Average hai but not better then realme c1	3

My charger not working properly	3
good	3
Best Phone In this Price Range	3
Very good in this range...	3
First time disappointed with redmi. NOT SURE WHY THEY GO LIKE SAMSUNG, the processor is a gimmik  Redmi used to create a wow effect in budget phones, but this time its just you get what you pay. Extend your budget and go for something good. The phone is utter slow, color reproduction is not upto mark. Youtube videos are pathetic. Redmi 4A was even better.	3
Music could have been better.. In the sense that at the bottom the speakers should have been there... Otherwise good	3
Lookwise the phone is good. Battery back up also nice. But it hangs up when connected to net. The display also goes blank. You can not use keyboard also. Its bad experience.	3
Product is good but batter back up could be better. Has issues with charging port and keep freezing at times.	3
It's ok ok product. I am using last 3 months. Only problem is picture quality on video call via whatapp. Where as Mi product costa 7k having better quality video call.	3
back camera not good ,less battery backup ,sensor nt working properly,most imp only having quad core processor	3
Build quality is ok. It has got good cameras and infinity display for the price	3
Battery life is very poor. Picture quality is OK. But not satisfied with its slow  processor. I recommend not to buy this phone. Buy an redmi 5. Instead of Micromax canvas infinity	3
Good.But rear camera is not really good as it is said.gaming is okay. UI is complicated.Dedicated sim and memory card slot is good for all.	3
the phones gets heated up after using the internet for more than 5 min ,not a very excellent product	3
Better options available in the mkt like MI, Asus, Moto etc..battery drains very fast, apps sometimes crash which I believe is bcoz of the 3gb ram..picture quality is not that great..	3
Purchased 9 months before. The performance is deteriorated like anything and have to go for new one. Not eligible for exchange also.	3
It ok but some times hanged. and also touch screen is not working properly	3
Ok but battery gets drained in the night time almost 50%, even i put phone on flight mode due to heavy bandwidth consume.	3
1. Battery life is not good you should make 4000mh battery instead of 2900...this things mobile more effective 2 screen glass quality is not good...	3
mobile ok, but didn't receive cashback, which was there for ICICI netbanking users between Jan1-Jan3 2018.	3
It's first good but later broke with the display could be better	3
I had bought it in sept 2017 and now itz speaker is nt working	3
Charging point is damaged before a year and the ui is laggy I think micromax has to work on that.Battery backup is good.camera is ok.	3
It's OK. Nothing great. The feel of bezel-less is not there even if it was promoted as a bezel-less phone. Battery life could have been better.	3
I want a duplicate bill of the product mobile : micromax infinity . The bill provided is erased automatically . So send me at the earliest.	3
Display not working some times after one month usage.for this model display glass not available anywhere and battery backup worst	3
Lot of bloatware, apps  installed from Appcenter which can not be disabled or uninstalled.. Mobile data not connecting immediately.. Hardware OK.	3

Just ok	3
Its a mixed bag. The things I like about it is the screen ratio, slim form factor and battery life. Things I don't like is the pushing of ads. Its irritating. And apps get cut or shrunk due to display form factor. And at times the phone freezes. Micromax still hasn't figured out software optimization.  The hardware isn't great. Snapdragon 425 is a below average CPU. Not good for gaming. Sound output via speakers are OK, but not up to mark via 3.5 mm audio jack. And 16mp front facing camera is just for sake of numbers. What will the pixels do if the optics are mediocre. I have seen many low megapixel cameras do a great job than this. Requires lot of light for good snaps.	3
Android Nougat is not at par with my previous phone's cyanogen OS. At least half a second lag in response. Downloaded the latest upgrade but still the same. Camera quality is OK. File manager app that I installed from play store is unable to move or delete files. App permission issue. Doesn't show which permission required. Tried by providing all access from app management, but such a versatile app is not allowed on my phone. Somebody please suggest a way out.	3
Good phone in this price range. Suited for normal day to day usage. Goods: 1.Large screen suited for watching HD movies. 2.Battery lasts more than a day with moderate usage. 3.Performance is as expected, no lags while playing heavy games like Asphalt8 4.Dedicated memory and 4G sim slots, and also removable battery. 5.Overall look and feel is premium. I have taken out one star cause : 1. Takes more time to charge, takes around 3 hours to charge from 20%-100%. expected a fast charger. 2.The screen display is not so crisp and sharp. Though you cant make out unless you have used premium mobiles. 3. Edit- Fragile screen with no gorilla glass. Screen shattered the first time it fell.	3
Everything looks good, except Camera(Both). I have used Micromax Canvas earlier and it has 8 MP and i compared both and my old mobile is far better than the this. Performance is excellent, little heating while playing games and while charging. Full display is awesome with touch. Returned the product due to Camera issue. No Stock to replace now.	3
I was too much excited when I purchased it but after using 15 day I I'm disappointed coz  heating problem r there n hanging also ..some tym touch also not working... I did blender I reorder it for my mom ....not met as I expected..	3
Today I got my phone one side sealed sticker was already opened and I don't know if it's predownloaded apps but there is already apps like fb, asphalt, modijis app which normally v have to download later	3
It's good phone in all features but some times hang and not displayed task bar and upper text of the phone... And after few minutes it shows automatically...	3
looks 4.5/5 Display 3/5 Battery 3/5 Camara 3/5 - Phone is very light weight - looks is very nice - camara quality not like oppo - phone handsfree is good not like cheap and sound quality is good - 2 Sim + Memory card -  Display is lakeing lot -  Heating issue some time -  HD display so not much brightness -  Battery drop quickly Infinix note 4 is better option	3
Phone is not so good its average phone best feature is 18:9 display only And batery is so poor and charge again and again for regular use as well as heavy usess ...and UI interface is so irritate i was returned my order and it will be done amazon have a great customer services Thankyou amazon	3
It is lagging after some time of use....battery is bad	3
Phone has lag of few seconds, battery should've been a bit more. Rest is okay with the phone. Thought Micromax is amnufactured in India and bought the phone. It is made in China.	3
Great phone in budget love to shape weight etc. Phone speaker is very bad sound is not clear to hear specially when i play vedio. Touch is gud but not very gud littil slow, clarity is gud. Over all this is a budget phn to buy. Gadget lover don't Buy this they have disopinted.	3
NOT AS EXPECTED MICROMAX IS POOR	3
Camera is bad quality  not like 13 mp and 16 mp just like 5 mp rear camera and 8 mp front camera but process is good and designed is perfect no doubt but camera is very bad	3
Average,  not bad, some time little bit hang	3
Honest review... I was mi note 3 user.  So I am writing on that mobile compare basis.... 1. Even mmx have snapdragon.. It's slow that mi. Slow opening of app, slow transition etc. 2. Battery  2900 mah works preety good. 3. Screen is good, but clarity is less than mi. 4. Image shown on box of mmx is fake. Mobile is of different look. 5. Front camera is 100% more good than mi note 3. 6.back camera is also better than mi. 7. Sound quality is little low than mi note 3. It's ok ok. 8. Overall mmx have done a good job. 9. Ui is also ok but still need little work. 10. It's not as user friendly as mi. 11. U can buy it.. 10 k is ok priced. 12. Both have there own feature. 13. Ignoring screen clarity, everything seems good in mmx. Satyam suresh singh 9118444999	3

Please ensure the product IMEI no (box- mobile- invoice ) Cross check the same	3
Over all performance is fair,but system apps such as calender n clock are not upto  the mark.cant set schedule in calender n there no link for settings in alarm.cant u fix it?what we should do to find a remedy?	3
NOTE : @ In this Review I am Explaining its Battery Performance in Detail with all possible data. @ The package includes the Screen Guard & Cover. @ Earphones included are of decent quality. @ There's Dedicated Sim slot in this Phone, so you can use both the sim cards & sd card together. @ I am uploading few Images taken from Rear Camera. I am NOT explaining the overwhelming features of this phone in Detail, which most of the other Reviewers have already explained. Just summing up Key observations, then will explain the Battery stats, Pros: 1) Processor coupled with RAM is above average and handles Moderate Level multitasking easily. * Out of 3 GB RAM less than 1.7 GB is free most of the time. 2) Good Call Quality and there's NO problem in signal reception. 3) Display is also Awesome and similar to LG Q6. 4) Internal memory is Average i.e. 32 GB, with 128 GB extendable. * Out of which only 22.31 GB is available. 5) Camera Quality is Impressive compared to the price tag. 6) Battery Life is above average (check the details below cons for Stats.) 7) Finger Print sensor is Lightening Fast. 8) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro, compass, etc. 9) Has Android Nougat out of the box. Cons: 1) NO Fast Charging and charging time is very long. 2) NO Image Stabilization, which gives shaky video output. 3) Back is bit Slippery. 4) Heats alot after 40 mins of usage. 5) Ram Consumption by System apps. as usual is High. BATTERY PERFORMANCE STATS : ---------------------------------------------------- # Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2hrs 15mins. with stock charger. Usage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.) ================================================ @ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continously ---> 8-10 Hrs. @ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> 18-20 Hrs. @ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 10 Hrs. @ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 6-7 Hrs. @ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 5-5.5 Hrs. @ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 5-6 Hrs. @ Video Playback ---> 9-10 Hrs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- VERDICT: If you are fond of Larger screen to body ratio, then certainly go for it. This is good budget phone and very apt alternative to Redmi 4. But if you are avid gamer and Heavy Multi-tasker, then better invest bit more and purchase some good phone like Moto g5s plus, Redmi Note 4, etc Thank You for reading this Review.	3
Mobile is very good but it's camera is not good ...very low camera .	3
Screen size is very small compare to regular mobile.	3
The  Charger, Handsfree, USB Cable, User Guide were not present with the phone. Disappointed.	3
In this mobile HDMI not support Why......	3
Definitely Not an infinity display. Don't get fooled by Micromax. Looks good though.	3
If use for 15 minutes it's getting heat.. battery also decharging very fastly...	3
Rear camera 13 Mp result is not good, while zoom there is a black spot seen in picture and also picture is not at mark	3
We get the phone but we dont get that idea sim	3
I didn't get user manual guide book	3
The infinity is the highlight feature of this phone.It offers 3gb of ram and 32gb of storage .It has a 5.7 inch Hd display which is quite impressive.2900Mah battery is a let down .425 Snapdragon has some heating issues.Overall a okay phone Please like if you found it helpful	3
Hanging issue	3
Just Like Samsung Micromax Launched It's Infinity Display Mobile Phone In This Competitive Market. These Are My Personal Inspection. Here Are Some Pros And Cons: Pros: 18:9 Screen At A Low Price Compact Phone Dedicated SIM And MicroSD Card Slots Cons: Display Quality Is Below Par Custom UI is Buggy Performance Is Sluggish	3
It is good in performance no doubt, i have used several micromax mbls But look is worst in ten thousand.. It is just like wearing no gold nd diamond rings but the dressing sense is like a beggar... In ten thiusand comp must give metallic body nd dynmic look	3
I love Micromax but why the battery is too low power	3
Mobile software is very poor and again problem continue camera quality is running and no megapixel total review poor.	3
Mobile looking and finishing is very good. But there is lot of bugs in the software. Need to update the software.	3
I got this product from Offline market for 10K. Decent product but does anyone face problem while calling?	3
This phone is good Bt have one problem When memory card aad in phone then phone not working properly	3
its too much hanging problem at starting time when data is on.	3
Baddest phone ever	3
Camera and display v good.but sound less..any how fine..	3
Good phon	3
Phone look very nice .... But Head phone quality is very bad...And head phone jak is not working well and sound is very low when connected to car system or any other sound system	3
You mean infinity like Samsung, I know it's worth it's price, but this absolutely is not a infinity display, nothing compared to s8 infinity. This phone is just a bulky, battery forever, not that great gaming, camera okay,  budget phone at 10K, so ya !!	3
1000 jyada le lo bas battery 4000 mAh kar do 	3
Good phone but interface with custom UI by micromax is not upto the mark	3
Good product at this price but battery backup is very poor	3
This phone has nice speed but the glass is not strong and customer service is not responsible for display!!	3
Redmi 6A has lag problems. This phone is hanging and lags while using YouTube and browser.Redmi 5A is far better than Redmi 6A. I am regretting on my decision for buying this phone. Not satisfied.	3
The cameras both front and rear are a huge disappointment as compared to redmi 4 and redmi 5a. I fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. Portrait mode doesn't work properly either. I don't expect the camera of S8 or iPhone in 6000 but other phones in the same price range certainly have better to offer. Other features work well but I was really let down with the camera this time.	3
Yes price is very low for this phone also it's performance,  after using for a week phone start to hang whenever you used 2 or more apps together and battery is also a issue I have to charge it two times in a day it drains quickly. First I give it 5 star but after using it I change it for 3	3
Pros: 1) Decent Video/audio recording with minimum distortion.   (noise cancellation is much much better than Redmi 5a)   2) Decent Camera for a budget phone.   3) good for Android smartphone beginners.   4) Can run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging.   5) Fast boot.   6) Good touch response for a budget phone,  I find it to extra sensitive. haha Cons: 1) Bad Video quality for watching movies/ you tube. But I use phone only for whatsapp and sometimes Instagram. I use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me.   2) Unable to share Internet hotspot to computer/Laptop. But I posted a tip on how to solve this problem in MI community India. All you need to do is download an app called PDANet+ (available in Google play store) in both your phone and computer. Go and check it out.   Apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. If you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. The 1440X720 resolution is much worse compared to Redmi 5a's 1280X720. In fact Redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to Redmi 6a.	3
Cons:   Build quality is OK as per price. Camera and Sound is average as expected at this price.  draining fast even on wifi (merely 7 to 8 hours of normal usage) on new battery. Some normal games lag a bit. Face lock doesnot work all the time (works nearly 70%). It is very irritating to have UI full of too many advertisement. Also the phone has too many bloatware preinstalled (can not be uninstalled). In my case I was getting problem with Proximity Sensor (So I returned it) Pros:   Phone dialler (built in) is awesome and it supports 2 volte enable sim at the same time. One can browse from Sim 1 and make call from Sim 2. It is as it was told.  Charging time is Ok. We can use Video Call directly from phone dialler. One can use Two Sim Card and One Memory Card at a time. Screen is awesome.	3
The worst thing on all mi phone is the gyroscopic sensor doesn't work,and personally after 3wk uses of mi6A , battery drain so quickly,face unlock never work properly even you can unlock the phone faster in pattern,better to invest more and go other good brand.	3
I purchased this mobile on lightning deal. After using few days and updating that Battery life is very worst. Charge is staying for only 4-5 hrs after fully charged even if it is ideal. still i am using only one SIM. if I use dual then not able to imagine the battery life. I guess, Amazon have cheated by offering this kind of deal.	3
Internet is very slow, I think, its not 2 GB RAM, It is a 512 MB RAM, other features is good.	3
Average product. Go 4 mi 6. Additional 2000 RS but you will get 3 GB RAM, dual camera and finger print sensor.	3
Not as good as Redmi 5A	3
The sound quality is just okk, low volume speaker make hardly audible tone in crowd. Battery is decent with medium usage last for half a day. Screen is not so impressive even it doesn't seems to be 720p display.	3
Excellent Mobile, the look of it is awesome. Metallic body is strong and sturdy. The OS performance is extremely good..	3
Average mobile in this range but i missing finger unlock feature.	3

hi	3
Nice Budget phone. Screen quality - HD+ Storage - Not up to mark, can expect so better to use SD cards. Dedicated SD card slot is good. Camera is as usual as other redmi phone have. This phone is not for those who like to play game in mobile. Overall 7 out of 10	3
Redmi 6a comes with classy look & light in wiight. Camera quality is moderate, comes with lot of installed apps which result 8.44gb vacant space. This mobile is not for those who use social media or heavy usage app bcz it start hanging at very early use. Acc to me..redmi 5a is much better than 6a.	3
Sound is not that much good	3
I was using redmi 5a which is really great .I have purchased it because i want dual volte at lower price but at this time redmi disappointed me because it has no fingerprint again and also IR BLASTER missing which is in redmi 5a .helio p22 is not so good as i tried to run pubgm in low graphics settings but it still hangs and i m not satisfied with camera quality as it's exposure is not good compared to redmi 5a otherwise it is same as redmi 5a .i have purchased it only due to dual volte	3
One day delivery was awesome. Storage available for usage is only around 8gb. Need to buy memory card. Price should be between 5 and 5.5k only. Not worth 6k. Feedback about battery and performance I will update after usage only.	3
Phone is good but video quality is not good ..when you see  YouTube ,Facebook video is not perfect play ..poor quality seen	3
got the phone at 9am, Looks good in hand, But disappointed only 7.83 GB Available out of 16 GB Which is very less, face unlock works Good, tried with photo not unlocked, But i took my photo in my friend's vivo 20mp camera and tried unlocked many times, this is very sad i am using PIN now, display under  sunlight OK with full brightness, Camera pictures good, bot front and rear, price should be 5000, not 6000 Redmi made name and looting now. will update about battery and performance after two days,	3
Speed is slowwwwww. Slippery Build quality not good. Call quality ok. Camera, Battery Ok. Spend 2k more and go for REAL ME 2. I am not a extreme user of mobile still i feel sluggish. Processor is not good i feel. Before buy, check multiple you tube videos. Don't get exited with flash sales. Will update the review after one week of usage.	3
Youtube app video dont play a good picture quality...rest all well in this price range	3
Not a great phone but cannot expect more than anything for this price. Poor camera quality and battery life is also not good. We cannot take the pics at night and this will work at day time some extent. Sound quality is not bad but not up to the marak. Screen resolution is not good.If someone is looking for Android phone for calling purpose go for it. For other purpose like gaming and watching videos and browsing choose other good RAM phone. Display-6/10 Design-6/10 Camera-5/10 Sound-6/10 Battery-4/10 Price -8/10	3
Over all average mobile,with good price	3
Camera is not good and processor is slow Battery backup is poor.	3
Network goes out Frequently.. Heats so much..camera quality is bad.	3
Good	3
Too much repairs in year of time	3
At this price point 6k mobile is hanging problem while switching one app to another app.	3
Its good only for senior citizens .. sound quality is good .. picture quality is ok . Battery backup is very good too ..Multitasking is worst .. phone freezes	3
Worth it	3
Nice Good and helpful delivery services	3
screen quality is very low and speaker sound is very low and not audible to another room.. lots of cost cutting in quality	3

The product is very good but the battery life and the processor is very poor if you have a low budget and you want to buy something very normal or good thing so this is so this product is very perfect for that requirement the camera quality is awesome but the vibration is not very good and the xiaomi keyboard is a very bad whenever I use Google keyboard Sonic keyboard replace it on Google so that's a bad thing about I see in this phone and yesterday I buy this phone and the day after tomorrow the phone is not working properly is this display is not working well so finally I restart and reboot and wipe all the data from this phone and then its fun working properly and charger cable is very the data cable is very low very small	3
hi	3
I m using this mobile from last 1 weeks. Few problems are like : 1. Face recognition is very slow, not up to the mark. 2. Phone was hang few time. Not very much satisfied with this.	3
mst phone h	3
I am not fully happy with the phone it  helps me in many ways. i can install many apps and mange my works by phone. Battery is decent but not for full one day usage. Camera is not that great, Picture quality is average. The positive thing is RAM for multiple apps	3
Calling sensor is very bad working	3
Red 6A screen quality less bettary so good not bad remaing good	3
Xiaomi has completely messed up the redmi 6 series with mediatek chipsets. I am a big fan of xiaomi and used to recommend xiaomi phones for all right from redmi note 3 times but Xiaomi isn't good these days. Mediatek chipset seems better only on paper, in real world performance even 1.5 yr old redmi 4A can easily beat it. Though rear camera quality has improved , selfie camera performance is disappointing. Battery life is no way close to the Redmi 4A or 5A. And the ram management,real world performance feels completely worst . Worst xiaomi phone ever. Now the under 7k market is filled with better devices like powerful Realme c1 , feature rich lenovo A5 and snappy Asus max lite so be wise to choose a good phone.Even redmi 5A is far better choice than this. Wish things get improved with Miui updates.	3
Average hai but not better then realme c1	3

My charger not working properly	3
good	3
Best Phone In this Price Range	3
Very good in this range...	3
First time disappointed with redmi. NOT SURE WHY THEY GO LIKE SAMSUNG, the processor is a gimmik  Redmi used to create a wow effect in budget phones, but this time its just you get what you pay. Extend your budget and go for something good. The phone is utter slow, color reproduction is not upto mark. Youtube videos are pathetic. Redmi 4A was even better.	3
Music could have been better.. In the sense that at the bottom the speakers should have been there... Otherwise good	3
Lookwise the phone is good. Battery back up also nice. But it hangs up when connected to net. The display also goes blank. You can not use keyboard also. Its bad experience.	3
Product is good but batter back up could be better. Has issues with charging port and keep freezing at times.	3
It's ok ok product. I am using last 3 months. Only problem is picture quality on video call via whatapp. Where as Mi product costa 7k having better quality video call.	3
back camera not good ,less battery backup ,sensor nt working properly,most imp only having quad core processor	3
Build quality is ok. It has got good cameras and infinity display for the price	3
Battery life is very poor. Picture quality is OK. But not satisfied with its slow  processor. I recommend not to buy this phone. Buy an redmi 5. Instead of Micromax canvas infinity	3
Good.But rear camera is not really good as it is said.gaming is okay. UI is complicated.Dedicated sim and memory card slot is good for all.	3
the phones gets heated up after using the internet for more than 5 min ,not a very excellent product	3
Better options available in the mkt like MI, Asus, Moto etc..battery drains very fast, apps sometimes crash which I believe is bcoz of the 3gb ram..picture quality is not that great..	3
Purchased 9 months before. The performance is deteriorated like anything and have to go for new one. Not eligible for exchange also.	3
It ok but some times hanged. and also touch screen is not working properly	3
Ok but battery gets drained in the night time almost 50%, even i put phone on flight mode due to heavy bandwidth consume.	3
1. Battery life is not good you should make 4000mh battery instead of 2900...this things mobile more effective 2 screen glass quality is not good...	3
mobile ok, but didn't receive cashback, which was there for ICICI netbanking users between Jan1-Jan3 2018.	3
It's first good but later broke with the display could be better	3
I had bought it in sept 2017 and now itz speaker is nt working	3
Charging point is damaged before a year and the ui is laggy I think micromax has to work on that.Battery backup is good.camera is ok.	3
It's OK. Nothing great. The feel of bezel-less is not there even if it was promoted as a bezel-less phone. Battery life could have been better.	3
I want a duplicate bill of the product mobile : micromax infinity . The bill provided is erased automatically . So send me at the earliest.	3
Display not working some times after one month usage.for this model display glass not available anywhere and battery backup worst	3
Lot of bloatware, apps  installed from Appcenter which can not be disabled or uninstalled.. Mobile data not connecting immediately.. Hardware OK.	3
Its nice look, smart, still lag behind, to be an user friendly, in comparison to lava.	3
Good screen size....poor battery backup..... overall average	3
Not very good some time set is working very slow & Hit Problem. Compare to range MI is far better.	3

In this budget good phone	3
Just ok	3
Its a mixed bag. The things I like about it is the screen ratio, slim form factor and battery life. Things I don't like is the pushing of ads. Its irritating. And apps get cut or shrunk due to display form factor. And at times the phone freezes. Micromax still hasn't figured out software optimization.  The hardware isn't great. Snapdragon 425 is a below average CPU. Not good for gaming. Sound output via speakers are OK, but not up to mark via 3.5 mm audio jack. And 16mp front facing camera is just for sake of numbers. What will the pixels do if the optics are mediocre. I have seen many low megapixel cameras do a great job than this. Requires lot of light for good snaps.	3
Android Nougat is not at par with my previous phone's cyanogen OS. At least half a second lag in response. Downloaded the latest upgrade but still the same. Camera quality is OK. File manager app that I installed from play store is unable to move or delete files. App permission issue. Doesn't show which permission required. Tried by providing all access from app management, but such a versatile app is not allowed on my phone. Somebody please suggest a way out.	3
Good phone in this price range. Suited for normal day to day usage. Goods: 1.Large screen suited for watching HD movies. 2.Battery lasts more than a day with moderate usage. 3.Performance is as expected, no lags while playing heavy games like Asphalt8 4.Dedicated memory and 4G sim slots, and also removable battery. 5.Overall look and feel is premium. I have taken out one star cause : 1. Takes more time to charge, takes around 3 hours to charge from 20%-100%. expected a fast charger. 2.The screen display is not so crisp and sharp. Though you cant make out unless you have used premium mobiles. 3. Edit- Fragile screen with no gorilla glass. Screen shattered the first time it fell.	3
Everything looks good, except Camera(Both). I have used Micromax Canvas earlier and it has 8 MP and i compared both and my old mobile is far better than the this. Performance is excellent, little heating while playing games and while charging. Full display is awesome with touch. Returned the product due to Camera issue. No Stock to replace now.	3
I was too much excited when I purchased it but after using 15 day I I'm disappointed coz  heating problem r there n hanging also ..some tym touch also not working... I did blender I reorder it for my mom ....not met as I expected..	3
Today I got my phone one side sealed sticker was already opened and I don't know if it's predownloaded apps but there is already apps like fb, asphalt, modijis app which normally v have to download later	3
It's good phone in all features but some times hang and not displayed task bar and upper text of the phone... And after few minutes it shows automatically...	3
looks 4.5/5 Display 3/5 Battery 3/5 Camara 3/5 - Phone is very light weight - looks is very nice - camara quality not like oppo - phone handsfree is good not like cheap and sound quality is good - 2 Sim + Memory card -  Display is lakeing lot -  Heating issue some time -  HD display so not much brightness -  Battery drop quickly Infinix note 4 is better option	3
Phone is not so good its average phone best feature is 18:9 display only And batery is so poor and charge again and again for regular use as well as heavy usess ...and UI interface is so irritate i was returned my order and it will be done amazon have a great customer services Thankyou amazon	3
It is lagging after some time of use....battery is bad	3
Phone has lag of few seconds, battery should've been a bit more. Rest is okay with the phone. Thought Micromax is amnufactured in India and bought the phone. It is made in China.	3
Great phone in budget love to shape weight etc. Phone speaker is very bad sound is not clear to hear specially when i play vedio. Touch is gud but not very gud littil slow, clarity is gud. Over all this is a budget phn to buy. Gadget lover don't Buy this they have disopinted.	3
NOT AS EXPECTED MICROMAX IS POOR	3
Camera is bad quality  not like 13 mp and 16 mp just like 5 mp rear camera and 8 mp front camera but process is good and designed is perfect no doubt but camera is very bad	3
Average,  not bad, some time little bit hang	3
Honest review... I was mi note 3 user.  So I am writing on that mobile compare basis.... 1. Even mmx have snapdragon.. It's slow that mi. Slow opening of app, slow transition etc. 2. Battery  2900 mah works preety good. 3. Screen is good, but clarity is less than mi. 4. Image shown on box of mmx is fake. Mobile is of different look. 5. Front camera is 100% more good than mi note 3. 6.back camera is also better than mi. 7. Sound quality is little low than mi note 3. It's ok ok. 8. Overall mmx have done a good job. 9. Ui is also ok but still need little work. 10. It's not as user friendly as mi. 11. U can buy it.. 10 k is ok priced. 12. Both have there own feature. 13. Ignoring screen clarity, everything seems good in mmx. Satyam suresh singh 9118444999	3

Please ensure the product IMEI no (box- mobile- invoice ) Cross check the same	3
Over all performance is fair,but system apps such as calender n clock are not upto  the mark.cant set schedule in calender n there no link for settings in alarm.cant u fix it?what we should do to find a remedy?	3
NOTE : @ In this Review I am Explaining its Battery Performance in Detail with all possible data. @ The package includes the Screen Guard & Cover. @ Earphones included are of decent quality. @ There's Dedicated Sim slot in this Phone, so you can use both the sim cards & sd card together. @ I am uploading few Images taken from Rear Camera. I am NOT explaining the overwhelming features of this phone in Detail, which most of the other Reviewers have already explained. Just summing up Key observations, then will explain the Battery stats, Pros: 1) Processor coupled with RAM is above average and handles Moderate Level multitasking easily. * Out of 3 GB RAM less than 1.7 GB is free most of the time. 2) Good Call Quality and there's NO problem in signal reception. 3) Display is also Awesome and similar to LG Q6. 4) Internal memory is Average i.e. 32 GB, with 128 GB extendable. * Out of which only 22.31 GB is available. 5) Camera Quality is Impressive compared to the price tag. 6) Battery Life is above average (check the details below cons for Stats.) 7) Finger Print sensor is Lightening Fast. 8) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro, compass, etc. 9) Has Android Nougat out of the box. Cons: 1) NO Fast Charging and charging time is very long. 2) NO Image Stabilization, which gives shaky video output. 3) Back is bit Slippery. 4) Heats alot after 40 mins of usage. 5) Ram Consumption by System apps. as usual is High. BATTERY PERFORMANCE STATS : ---------------------------------------------------- # Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2hrs 15mins. with stock charger. Usage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.) ================================================ @ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continously ---> 8-10 Hrs. @ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> 18-20 Hrs. @ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 10 Hrs. @ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 6-7 Hrs. @ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 5-5.5 Hrs. @ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 5-6 Hrs. @ Video Playback ---> 9-10 Hrs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- VERDICT: If you are fond of Larger screen to body ratio, then certainly go for it. This is good budget phone and very apt alternative to Redmi 4. But if you are avid gamer and Heavy Multi-tasker, then better invest bit more and purchase some good phone like Moto g5s plus, Redmi Note 4, etc Thank You for reading this Review.	3
Mobile is very good but it's camera is not good ...very low camera .	3
Screen size is very small compare to regular mobile.	3
The  Charger, Handsfree, USB Cable, User Guide were not present with the phone. Disappointed.	3
In this mobile HDMI not support Why......	3
Definitely Not an infinity display. Don't get fooled by Micromax. Looks good though.	3
If use for 15 minutes it's getting heat.. battery also decharging very fastly...	3
Rear camera 13 Mp result is not good, while zoom there is a black spot seen in picture and also picture is not at mark	3
We get the phone but we dont get that idea sim	3
I didn't get user manual guide book	3
The infinity is the highlight feature of this phone.It offers 3gb of ram and 32gb of storage .It has a 5.7 inch Hd display which is quite impressive.2900Mah battery is a let down .425 Snapdragon has some heating issues.Overall a okay phone Please like if you found it helpful	3
Hanging issue	3
Just Like Samsung Micromax Launched It's Infinity Display Mobile Phone In This Competitive Market. These Are My Personal Inspection. Here Are Some Pros And Cons: Pros: 18:9 Screen At A Low Price Compact Phone Dedicated SIM And MicroSD Card Slots Cons: Display Quality Is Below Par Custom UI is Buggy Performance Is Sluggish	3
It is good in performance no doubt, i have used several micromax mbls But look is worst in ten thousand.. It is just like wearing no gold nd diamond rings but the dressing sense is like a beggar... In ten thiusand comp must give metallic body nd dynmic look	3
I love Micromax but why the battery is too low power	3
Mobile software is very poor and again problem continue camera quality is running and no megapixel total review poor.	3
Mobile looking and finishing is very good. But there is lot of bugs in the software. Need to update the software.	3
I got this product from Offline market for 10K. Decent product but does anyone face problem while calling?	3
This phone is good Bt have one problem When memory card aad in phone then phone not working properly	3
its too much hanging problem at starting time when data is on.	3
Baddest phone ever	3
Camera and display v good.but sound less..any how fine..	3
Good phon	3
Phone look very nice .... But Head phone quality is very bad...And head phone jak is not working well and sound is very low when connected to car system or any other sound system	3
You mean infinity like Samsung, I know it's worth it's price, but this absolutely is not a infinity display, nothing compared to s8 infinity. This phone is just a bulky, battery forever, not that great gaming, camera okay,  budget phone at 10K, so ya !!	3
1000 jyada le lo bas battery 4000 mAh kar do 	3
Good phone but interface with custom UI by micromax is not upto the mark	3
Good product at this price but battery backup is very poor	3
This phone has nice speed but the glass is not strong and customer service is not responsible for display!!	3
Though at this price cannot expect much it is worth for the price, below is my opinion I feel the Android is buggy and bolted with unnecessary apps Its very difficult to hear ringtone if the phone is kept on any surface screen facing up There is no increase of ringtone option need to navigate to settings to do that Auto brightness is no use, not much difference when u go to sunlight brightness is very low Camera seems good did not find much issues Battery drains faster compared to Redmi 5A Need to have some back cover as it is quite slippery	4
Phone looks good and fits in hand, 2gb is normal as its a basic mobile, I liked the feature dual 4g support from both sims where as this option is not available in top mobiles and 2 nano + memory upto 256 is additional advantage, but main draw back is Xiaomi removed IR Blaster. I was  planning for 2 pieces but due to (IR Blaster non availablity)  I ordered Redmi Note 5 pro and this one for cousin. Comes with Oreo update	4
Phone is okay.. Fine for normal use. Phone is little bit slow. Sound quality is little low than other mi phones. IR remote is missing. It was better to add fingerprint sensor by hiking price a little. Other features are fine as like other mi phones.	4
Superb phone in budget Can't ask more Loved everything about phone It's amazing If you have budget of 6000 then go for it blindly I gifted it to my grandfather,he is more than happy	4
You will Get Dual 4G You Are Looking For. Decent Camera Don't expect Much From A 6k Device.less heat Compared To Previous 5A.You Will Only Feel For The Internal memory.	4
Phone specs looks good. But not up the mark. Sound quality is very poor. Redmi 4a was far better. Camera portrait mode works good thanks to The helio processor.	4
Performance is better than other device.. i recommended to buy the Redmi 6A.	4
Yas good mobile in India Redmi 6 athis mobile phone purchase efficiency good and very budget phone Indian peoples so like that all people use  phone very good features phone condition and working screen working and almost do Indians like this phone good mobile processor xiaomi redmi 6a	4
First of all delivery time take a long. display is also this range is good. processor is best not good for gamers to play pubg and GTA Sa. more lagging to play. battery backup to good..Screen ratio is superb in this smartphone and last sounds quality is medium.	4
my suggestion is only that sound speaker should be more powerful as per redmi given its previous every phones. it looks very nice and slim. processor is very fast, good battery life, good nm technology. overall it is the best phone in this price.	4
Redmi 6a comes with classy look & light in weight. Camera quality is moderate, comes with lot of installed apps which result 8.44gb vacant space. This mobile is not for those who use social media or heavy usage app bcz it start hanging at very early use.	4
At this price it is best handset Dual 4g volte support Antutu score about 65k Only battery backup is little less but it is good for daily use lasted for 24 hous	4
Design is very good. dint find any heating issue after playing game for lang time. Battery life is good. Camera quality is satisfactory.	4
The mobile phone is very good looking for its price and build quality is very nice as well , all features work fine ( have not used the face unlock till now) will update review after long use	4
"Good Phone for the price... No finger print scanner makes it slightly off beat. However, looks good and works well too.. Only issue I face, is the calls going to ""hold"" by itself intermittently"	4
The sound quality is not upto mark when we take video. Battery and screen quality is good.It has MIUI 9 in it and have upgraded to MIUI 10 at delivery date. Everything was excellent except the delivery partner.I have to collect myself .	4
Purchased for my father.. he loved it .. especially face unlock . ..  very light weighted... Display sounds good... But camera couldn't satisfy me... Overall it's the most economic deal at 6000	4
Sound is very lees in comparison and drains battery fast when using internet. But overall it seems to be good for rs 6000	4
Price should be less than 5k or tempered glass n case should be in box	4
Battery backup not as compare to other redmi mobiles whos contain polymer battery this time li-oin battery not good	4
I just bought this phone. only 1 week. so far performing good. But I think it cannot match my MI remi 6A which is almost the same price. Battery is dittachable, hence handy, no techy is required	4
Value for enough money,  with this price this is the number one in the market.  Please don't compare with others.  Because it's like it self. Really value for money.	4
Xiaomi products are always up to the mark, similarly this product is also good, having all features. Just fingerprint is missing, otherwise great phone.	4
Mobile phone very good but delivery boy behavior very very bad	4
Good phone in this price segments light weight comfortable in hand betry also good camera good screen quality also good but sound quality not good overall nice phone in this price	4
Everything was fine but, youtube very slow and sometimes it will test your patience.	4
Mobile is good but some time it is not responding Good battery life sound and screen quality is very good But Amazon packaging of this product is very bad..	4

Normal features as always . But not that's much as compare to realme by oppo , realme is also best in this price segment . Thanks	4
Look wise very beautiful phone, screen HD+ very clear, sound quality ok but ringtone volume low,  processor speed is good for normal user.	4
Only thing i dont like is home screan take 2-3 seconds take to load after exit games, i played pubg too i dont see lags superb mobile	4
Phone feels good..easy for normal use...	4
Not bad in this price heating so much , charging time 3 hours very bad	4

osm product i found the redmi 6a in 2 sell. the redmi 6a is a very good phone as compare to this price	4
Nice Mobile based on Price but few APP's are not working like Citi Bank App, APSRTC payments	4
i like this product very much,but back cover not comes with this  handset it is little desapointed.	4
Redmi never lets us upset ,this is also a gud mobile in the budget segment	4
Iam not received the Invoice And Bill with Gaurantee card, please forward through my email	4
Everything is fine for a moderate user but may lag a bit and have battery issues with heavy users.	4

Model 8/10 Screen 9/10 Battery 6/10 Camera 7/10 ROM should be 32 GB  as 16 GB is very low, I am using external 64 GB card because 75% space is used to install apps. only 25% of internal memory is available for storage. this phone may useful for beginner.	4
Look beautiful	4
Awesome phone in  6000 pros 1 large screen and good display 2 face unlock 3 good processor 4 no lag 5 google assistant is working fine 6 Dual 4g 7 Light weight cons 1 camera is not that good as i expected as i also have samsung on 5 and the focus of on5 camera is far better than 6A it is difficult to focus on object like flowers etc,because of focus image becomes blurry 2 sometimes faceunlock may not work overall its good phone in this budget	4
At this price range this is best smartphone option available. When we compare it with 5A , 6A has bigger screen, face unlock and better display quality. While 6A has 2Ghz quadcore Mediatek Helio A22 processor, 5A has 1.4 Ghz quadcore snapdragon 425 processor , that means 6A has latest processor, but I have seen some YT videos stating that 5A has better performance than 6A. Best feature of this device I liked is it has active 4G on both SIM cards. Face id takes little time to unlock phone but its fine at this price range. Must buy. You won't get any other phone at this price range with these feature.	4
best phone in this budget, bought for my Mom, she is happy with it, big screen with small form factor.good if not best camera, good sound quality from audio jack.	4
Awesome phone under 7k *Good camera *Good screen *Good sound clarity *Good battery	4
Front and back camera is good. But screen resolution is not good.	4
Guys its a budget phone,never expect more from it,for regular and normal use its better in the market in this price range. Seems good after few days usage.. Battery back up ok for 1.5days. Screen resolution not fhd but ok...good for eye. Processor not for gamers. You need to buy a memory card for it. Both Camera good for this price. Sound not so loud but clear. U can delete pre-installed unnecessary apps to clear the ram and make the phone fast. Dual nano sim 4G support and 256GB expandable memory feature is best Point of this phone. For budget phone users go for it....	4
One day delivery was awesome. Got the phone 11.45 . Phone is very good, looks so nice camera ok. But storage 8GB out of 16 GB, its very disappointing, otherwise redmi is a top selling brand 	4
Amazing phone	4

I don't like the display very much specially while stream on YouTube and phone also lags a bit	4
Phone is worth. Only battery mh is i think low. Now not a problem in future Batery one days full use or not i don't know	4

Best phone under 6000.	4
One of the best phones in between these months. Battery life is very good, sound quality is perfect and picture quality is too good. Also it is not heating ;that's the best thing I liked a lot.Totally a perfect phone in a suitable budget for Indian people. In a single word for saying about this phone is COMPLETE PERFECT. The bill sent by  Amazon or the seller is not very good quality so that in a damaging situation within warranty period may create difficulty. This is the one thing that I haven't get any answer yet.For this reason I don't give full rating. I am giving two opinions about the phone & the warranty or payment bill of this product from my own experience. Choice is Yours.	4
5.45 inch Screen is good, 3000mah battery not sufficient for this screen size phone and Overall Good quality phone Redmi. Brought it for 6k	4
Good	4
Love the phone. Everything on it works as expected.  I've been using this phone for about 1 weeks, and so far I'm loving it. Here's me breakdown: The quality, fit and finish are amazing. No one believes this is low priced phone. Battery: exceptional battery life, the best in any smartphone I've had so far. Build/design: one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I've used, even compared to much more expensive models. Camera: not as good as my Honor 7C, but still takes good enough pictures that it's not really a problem for me. Really littil bit difficult to find fault with this phone, especially for the price even I don't like the audio quality. overall Best Product. Durable solid feel, very responsive and works great overall.	4
Overall good phone .	4

Camera Quality Good,  Worth for Money	4
Nice in this price range	4
I like display  quality of mobile it's just awesome at this price....	4
Everything is fine at this price range...	4
What one could expect for a 6k price . If someone wants a phone within 6k segment this is the best. Go for it but do not expect much.	4
Its best for moderate users. Perfect in budget and much better performance at this price of 5999. It has nice design and looks nice.  It is light weight, slim and battery easily lasts for one day. Camera quality is not best but it's good and give clear shots. Getting dual 4g at this price is awesome thing. Screen display is best. Only thing I found bad was a little bit lagging while using heavy apps or games otherwise best option for normal users who don't use heavy apps or games (like pubg. Its lags a little even with minimum pixels). On looking the price tags it's best at 6k price range.	4
I like likethis price segment phone at the brand. But this time not for sure is this value for money.	4
Good	4
Very nice economical product at awesome price range of 6000...redmi maintained class in smartphone...Sexy looks.... Almost all the features included except fingerprint sensor... Picture quality may not be as  good expected..	4

Nice phone Redmi 6a	4
1. Picture Quality 4star 2. Sound Quality  5star 3. Camera Quality 4star 4. Memory 3star 5. Processor speed 5star 6. Battery 4star	4
PRO: 1. Slick design and low weight 2.Camera is very good 3.Display hd+ ..worth it 4.Miui..user friendly CONS: 1.Battery life is poor..but will last 2 days on standard use 2. Under sun it's hard to see the display 3. Sound quality is a little low...but no problems hearing via call Overall a very good budget phone at this price. Now let's see how long it lasts.	4
Camera is descent Very good mobile phone in 6000 price range there are also other phone in this range but guys go for this one trust me MI mobile are very good ...they are giving overall package means other phone either they will give good quality camera ,battery, design etc  for e.g. oppo and Vivo mobile there camera are good but overall I dont like they are putting hell lot of money on advertisements and not on product ...but if you go for mi they are near to perfection in giving value for money... I really trust this brand according to me they are new SAMSUNG  the way they we used to trust this brand for smart phone e.g. galaxy y series but now they are lagging behind This what I feel first phone which I order was mi 4i for my sister which she used almost three years without any issues then boom my whole family mi product Mi 4i , Redmi 3s, note 3,note 4, Redmi 4, Redmi y2,Redmi 5a ,Redmi 6a trust me till now none of mi product has disappointed us .... Redmi 6a is very decent phone for parents If you found my review helpful Please give helpful vote	4

Got the black 6A(2gb/16gb) today thru amazon. First impression : Looks: lovely. MIUI s/w: impressive. Camera quality: superb. Sound: not bad. Sleek & light. MI offers this phone at a price which is probably unthinkable to its competetors. Glad to have chosen MI Redmi 6A.	4
This  budget that mobile super	4
Good product but missing fingerprint senser and earphone Value for money	4

Very Good Phone From Xiaomi	4
Redmi 6a is good product. But 2gb ram is less for smooth functioning. Picture and sound quality is best but battery is average.  It's only 6-7 hours battery life if you charge fully then. You get MIUI 10 in redmi 6a. In camera you got portrait mode for selfies. Rear camera quality is too good. But it's work on mediatek this is it's minus point. Screen 5.5 inches. All over I like this phone.	4
Value for money ,,,good product	4
overall it's best phone in this budget.  I got it 15 days ago till now I didnt face any issue.	4

Sound quality isn't good...its much worse because of the speaker facing backwards.....mediatek processors are known for heating and battery issues...and yet they used mediatek processor.... compromising the processor lowered the price...other than that, Redmi 6a is an awesome mobile phone with no lagging issues...great screen quality...3000 mah battery... and a good camera for the price	4

Was giving a thought on buying the real me c1, but passed it on since the OS in real me sucks big time as its mostly unpolished. So this was the 2nd best option after that. Pros: Good Battery life. Dual 4g support. Design wise its easy to operate, poly carbonated body ensures the durability but placement of speakers could have been at the bottom. User interface, though noticed some hiccups, nothing an update can't solve. A better Chip than SD425. Light weight. Display is good for the pricing. Cons: Removal of the IR blaster. Average Camera, though didn't have high hopes for it as per the pricing. Additional apps or bloatware, if you know how to deal with them, it shouldn't be the case.	4
Good budget phone .. loved it !!!	4
Nice phone..	5
Awesome entry level smartphone. Face unlock works a bit slow. But okay. The processor is less power consuming. Full screen display works like charm. A five star for 1.5 day delivery by Amazon. Redmi has lot improved in the music quality section. Pretty decent overall performance. Good choice. Go for it in 6k budget before price rise again.	5
It's such an amazing budget phone. MI rocks. The display is so good. Sound is awesome. Camera works decent. It has face recognition which works well. Its design is amazing and the weight is so light. There was no lag in the phone. It works perfectly well for normal applications. Video quality is amazing. 4g works well. 5.45inch screen is big enough it's cool. I'm sure there are still lots of features in this 6k phone! Grab it before the introductory offer is gone, else you will end up paying 7k for same phone.	5
i got what i expected no over heating , Getting 36 hours battery back up with usage of you tube, news, voice sometimes, and without whats app.  Out of 2GB, 950 MB left for free which is sufficient for normal users. 8GB ROM free. Loaded apps are MS Office apps, all google, Mi apps security, cleaner, drop, video, store, community, Other apps, amazon, facebook, phonepe, netflix, dailyhunt, share chat, opera. Updates to MUIU 10, Charging takes 3 hrs. Pros. Two sides mic, Very good touch, Good camara's, No lag, Separate slot for Mem card. Cons: No gorilla glass, No front flash but blur effect on back view. Ring is avg loud. Indoors good, but outdoors we should concentrate.	5
If u want to gift for parents I think this will be good option.This phone is not for heavy users that doesn't mean that u cannot use this for daily use .Yes u can use but playing heavy games like pubg etc will impact the performance. For the price this phone is good. Pros: Build quality is decent,Camera is good both front and back for this price ,display is good,decent battery life,Dual 4g volte ... Cons: Performance is average not the best in this price range but for daily use this will phone will be good. Should have provided case or screen guard in the box. I am not the big fan of miui (It is personal preference) Annoying Ads in miui . (Hope this comment is helpful)	5
It's the best budget phone available. Could bag it in the very first sale at 8 am. Previously used mi phones and very much satisfied with it. Thanks to Amazon for making this available every two hours.	5
I purchased this for my mother who is a first time user of smart phone. MIUI is comfortable. A good budget phone by Xiaomi. It has a good battery life almost 3 days life. Pictures quality is also good at this budget price. A little disappointing Sound quality side since speakers are kept on back side of the phone.	5
"Very nice phone.... specially screen is awesome...camera is okay...sound quality is great... Overall for this prise this phone is better option. One thing Mi forgot for this phone is ""IR blast""...that is missing."	5
Wow Yaar it's looking so good and performance is awesome.. Over all good	5
