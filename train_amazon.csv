Was glad to see made in India label inside the phone. But when I saw the charger it said "made in china". Still OK. Now I thought of charging the phone a bit.. just 5 minutes after setting the new phone. As soon as I connected the charger to the socket, there was a spark and shot circuit in the charger, phone was not connected. So go disappointed. I am not returning this phone as I have already gifted it. Not sure if Amazon seller would be able to send replacement for the charger alone. Amazon never replaced the product even after multiple conversations..	2
Its not even one year of product purchase, and phone doesn't work well.If we want to make a call, we need to use the earphone, or else we need to put the phone in loud speaker.Back camera doesn't work.Flash light doesn't work some times.Not happy with the product.	1
Very fast processing and very good looking phone at low price experience like Apple phone	5
realy grat product by micromax amazing one more time king back to the market keep it on micromax	5
After 1month useage, in this price range it's good mobile, worth for every paise, camera in normal condition good, finger print okok ,battery for moderate user complete day, sound quality is not up to the mark, screen quality in sunlight good	4
Worst product worst customer service in warranty period	1
Better than Redmi Note 4... Using this phone since last 6 months..no problem at all.. Everything is good in this phone under the price range 10k... A better try from Micromax to get back into the market...	5
worst product, dont even charge properly, poor customer care, no replacement, no guarantee, horrible experience!	1
Highly NOT RECOMMENDED While ordering I was like I'm ordering Indian make handset with patriotic feeling and expected the unexpected :(Pathetic phone, received defected peice, got it exchanged after so much hassle, again received faulty handset. If someone calls me other person can't hear me properly. They think I've put the on speaker and speaking from other room with phone in other room. So awful.	2
Whatever this phone might have been capable of has been completely ruined by the software on this phone and despite almost everybody calling it out to micromax, there is no hint of any improvement regarding the same.After almost an year using this phone, I would not recommend this or any other micromax phone for that matter. To what extent do we settle with this company for the sake of patriotism, atleast the Chinese are working hard and competing with apple, and here is micromax only interested in churning in money by reselling the fruit of Chinese hardwork. Great example of pathetic leadership and certainly not a company that shows any patriotism or deserves the patriotic support shown by Indians towards this company !	1
Got this phone delivered on 15th aug, using it for more than 15 hours now. Facing problem with battery drainage, it reduces like 20% with normal usage in less than an hour. By normal usage I mean even updating the contact details as it is new phone. Also when the phone is not in use i.e on standby it reduces 5-7% in an hours time.So 20% drainage in 1hr is really bad. Hence applying for Return.	2
This is a really worst phone .This phone is arise ao many software problems .Like hanging,slow working apps..Touch will be loose with in a short period of time ..And lack of servicing centers ...Even small crash on phone also this phone unworthy for warranty ... Software update kavalante 300/-.at services centre.,such a big mistake in my daily usage..So plz beware of this phone	1
Amazing Smartphone under 10k, Camera is mind blowing.Everything are working well.No Issues 	5
Phone looks good in all aspects however the display screen heats up while using it for sometime. I received the product yesterday. I will use it for few days and see whether the problem continues. Other than this heating up problem evrything seems to be fine.	4
Battery backup is good, both camera captures good pictures but I would prefer rear camera as 16 mp instead of front camera. One drawback of this phone that it looks like 5.2 inch screen display.	4
Not at all a good phone ...Battery lags and the performance is also not up to the mark.Biggest mistake that I bought it.	1
Excellent made in India product by Micromax, but company is slow in producing more products like this. Market value is less due to costly & slow productions.	5
A very good product under 10k. I'm using it from 10 months and believe me nothing has gone wrong by this phone.Screen is good.Camera is awsm.Sound quality is good.Look is awsm.Overall performance is very nice.The only thing that disappointed me is its battery life.	4
low volumecant speak on this phone unless we use headphoneeven for incoming calls bell doesnt ringshown to many service stations.... no luck	1
I always wanted to buy an Indian phone as a part of promoting Indian market.... This phone really fitted my bill.... Good performance and almost all features of mi series.... I'm loving it.... Not suitable for playing high end graphic games....	4
good	4
It's the phone which has the value for the money you pay.Very gud display and storage.	4
Phone is good. But In this one year, there is No security updates, no bug fixes updates and no Oreo update from Micromax. Worst customer service centre. During the initial release they promised about Oreo update. But even they not providing proper security updates and bug fixes updates.	1
Very bad product, worst picture and sound quality....processor is very low....All my money gine waste...AMAZON....very poor product...you are spoiling your image..	1
Very Good Phone on Battery back UP and other features	5
Lookwise the phone is good. Battery back up also nice. But it hangs up when connected to net. The display also goes blank. You can not use keyboard also. Its bad experience.	3
Dual sim, removavle battery is the best featured offered. But,there is no exchange Blair for this phone.	4
nice mobile. I loved it..........low price but lot of fecilities......but plzzz extened the battery level.........	5
Not a very good phone for price. Lags a bit sometimes. Not that fast, design is cheap.	5
Worth for the money spent ... really happy that I bought this product. If it would have native android it would have been awesome :) although no complains.	4
Worth's every penny. Excellent phone .Only I miss its gorilla glass so you should be carefully handle this and its cover and screen gaurds are not available in market easily	4
Very good for the given price. Been using it for 3 days now, not slow at all. I like it. I feel its one of the best in its price range. Micromax can make a good comeback with this phone.	5
Phone was average but unfortunately it stopped working after 7 months and .. service is even worst I am still waiting for serviced return... my advice never go for any micromax product.. better to buy Chinese at least no service expectations....	2
Just superb in look n performance	4
Good phone.	5
Phone is good for those who use internet and play light games..overall product is gud..battery is good enough..yes heating is there but lite..	5
Very good mobile. Low SAR. Good features. Extremely happy with the performance. Importantly it is an Indian mobile company. Support made in India products.	5

Excellent product	5
i am using this mobile from last 6 month and within 6 months i found that battery backup is not proper system is getting hang, and there is no exchange offer with particular this model even though on amazon..	1
It was worth buying this phone.  Under 10k if you get such features like 13 mp camera both, 18:9 full vision, 3 gb ram, and the best part one can use dual SIM + memory card all 3 are accessible. Battery reasonably Ok, not so good, but not so bad either.	4
Awesome look, perfect front selfie camera, good rear camera, no heating problem, sufficient battery back up, best picture quality.. Full paisa vasul phone.. Thanks Micromax	5
Build quality is ok. It has got good cameras and infinity display for the price	3
I still give 4 to this amazing phone,inspite of little poor in fingerprint sensor.others things are working awesome.	4
Camera quality are good.. Rear and front both are portrait mode..Battery backup was good...Phone are best in this price range	5
Very delicate, screen broke only on a small drop.Camera and screen is good, but the build quality should be improved.	1
Bad mobile	1

Good Phone at affordable price.	4
Its good for the price.	4
Good	5
Best phoneIt has 3gb ram with 32gb storage and works perfectly.Amazon sent it in perfect condition. The delivery was early too!	5
The mobile is very good.It's biggest plus point is it's big screen and the front selfie camera which takes very good pics.Good battery backup. Smooth functioning.Value for money.	5
Amazing screen size beautiful looks nd user friendly recommended for daily use no lagging till now battery backup is quite good I don't no why people criticise it without using it it's best budget smart phone available which is from Indian company	5
Good product fine working	4
Good.But rear camera is not really good as it is said.gaming is okay. UI is complicated.Dedicated sim and memory card slot is good for all.	3
When I ordered the phone will in 2 days it will deliver am so happy this phone is amazing	4
Perfect phone value for money.. camera is excellent. Battery is good. Phone performance is good. Indian brand phone go for it. Much better than MI.	5
Purchased in Dec 2017. Phone hangs very often. Need to restart phone at least 4 to 5 times a day. If phone is not restarted, it is not reachable to others even though there is good network.	1
the phones gets heated up after using the internet for more than 5 min ,not a very excellent product	3
It's cool and have great features,as I'm a student it as all the things what I want . Thank you Amazon . happy.	5
Excellent phone with great features. Make in India... would highly recommend for it.	5
Better options available in the mkt like MI, Asus, Moto etc..battery drains very fast, apps sometimes crash which I believe is bcoz of the 3gb ram..picture quality is not that great..	3
The smartphone that I recieved was made in china .the ui of the smartphone was not at all good .the infinity display was quite impressive.the overall performance of the device was pretty good . It is a great value for money device	4
Overall a good phone but there are no screen protectors in the market for this phone and if by luck u find one then it will not fit on to it	4

Also, the price at which this phone is being offered by the seller is far cheaper than the price being quoted by the sellers in my locality here in Mumbai suburbs. India Post was very quick with the delivery, and kept me well updated.As for the product, I have used Micromax A310 for the last three years without having to repair it even once in the past three years! It is still in excellent condition. So, I was absolutely stress free when I decided that I wanted another Micromax phone. So far, I absolutely love this piece for the following aspects:-high quality cameras-immersive display-loud and crystal clear sound-customizable UI-absolute smooth functioning (with no heating or hanging)-classy look and feel-the cover, protector, and all the stuff that comes in the box-those lovely in-built Micromax apps (like the alarm which rings even when the phone is off, I can never overlook these tiny blessings)There's too much to add here, but I don't have the time. So, I'll summarize it as a 'must buy.'	5
This is the first Micromax mobile i had bought thinking its made in india. I was bit disappointed as the pack said "make in china". The phone is good and performance so far has been great. Charge remains for a long time ... 2 + days. Camera photos are of good quality.	3
This product is OK OK, can't compite with China sadly, ordered because of Indian company, but it is manufacturered in China, lot of lags switching apps, lots of unwanted notification via micromax app store, can't uninstall it, OK cameras, battery backup is poor, as ram management, purchased for 9500 and now it is at 8400, within a month ,no resale as expected, it is that much annoying the notification are that I have kept it aside, can't use it it is disturbing	2
I have been using this phone for quite a 2 months performance is excellent battery is good No hanging or heating problem	5
Everything is good about this phone. Using since two months. Only problem is it hangs sometimes. And the battery is 2900 mAH which is lesser for a price of 9999	4
All features are best but the battery performance is awesome. I show a film which nearly about 1 hour & 45 minutes but it consume only 12% charge while for same film my redmi mobile consume nearly 35% battery. So i preferred to buy this phone. Camara and other features are also good.	5

The first time I'm writing a review.Absolutely Great device. No display issue as mentioned in some reviews. They probably don't know how to use 18:9 Ratio device. FP is fking Speedy af. Great camera. And Battery *_* 8-9hrs+ on Full time LTE Connection (Browsing.YT.FB.WA.Telegram.G+. Was using yureka 2500mAh which was giving only 3hrs of SOT on 3G. But this 1 is Awsm. 5.7 inch Infinity display gives complete new experience. If u budget is 10k - 11k then go for it. The Best MMX Device till now. LG Q6 Killer. #CanvasInfinity	5
Micromax is back with huge screen with small size body. Although it is a hd screen 720p due to the less bezels on all sides the display looks awesome. Thank you for the 18:9 full vision screen . The only drawback is the back camera and made in China but at this price it's the best deal and micromax also promising that the 48 hours service otherwise they will replace with a new mobile. Battery backup also good it can last for one day easily. There is no fast charging but it's taking around 90 minutes to full charge	4
The touch sensitivity of this phone is totally flawed. You cannot disconnect calls at times. You can'y answer calls at time. Try using the calculator. At times you press on any number, sign ... only "x" sign comes. I have used Micromax before and never experienced such discomfort with any of their phones. This one is really not a phone I would recommend to anyone.	1
Firstly very good phone in this price range. Bought this phone for 9000 after cashback.Good Camera quality.. Front camera is really good and selfiee lovers will like it.Decent battery back up even you use with wifi or mobile data.I am not a game lover so didnt test on playing games.Look & Feel is also good. Strong back case.Good design by micromax.Attractive feature which is full vision display.Very Moderate heating issues which is ignorable.So overall Performance wise i can give rating as 4.Few drawbacks are. No fast charging, Display light is low. Processor is not much latest and it's just quad-core but not octa core. But its okay for this price range.Undoubtedly you can go for it. Good product by Micromax.	4
Good brand good performance awesome experience but battery backup only 1 day!!	4
Happy with the phone and its build quality.....  All good but battery can be better.....  Camera is great  in this price range.... Ur can be better and some pre apps are irritating if u unnistall these apps....  After you restart  or reboot  the phone the apps came along.....  This is sometimes irritating......  Overall in this price range I suggest  you to buy this phone.....	4
Great device under 10k. Bought it almost 50days ago. Extremely satisfied with performance.Pros:1) Great infinity display2) Camera is quite good on both sides. The front flash really Sparks it up.3) super fast charging of 0-100% in about 1-1.2 hours only.4) More than average battery backup.Cons:1) Battery could've been more powerful. It's about 3k mAh.	5
Camera is  superb,especially selfies are superb.Works smoothly,Batary Lasts for a day.(Moderate use).UI is NiceOverall Good phone under 10K compared to MI and Motorola Phones.	5
very good product from micromax value for money .premium quality product.good louder speaker,good os look,good selfie cam and back cam too.faster finger print unlock,headphone not bad.(its better than other headphones included with china brand phone ).	5
Supurb phone...After using iPhone for 6 years I wanted to try an Android device especially Indian made. I am loving this product. Didnt' see a point wasting 60 to 70K to go for an iPhone when better features ( infinity display, 16 MP camera, Android 7.2 ) all are available in 10 K....trust me Netflix , FB and YouTube experience is rocking on this device	5
Nice mobileBack camera averageFront camera awesomeNo hangingExcellent battery backupAmazing display10000rs super mobile	5
Worth for money.I bought it in Amazon last month in the mindset of supporting indian producr. Luckilh working good as expected. A good come back for Micromax in the market.Pros:Good full vision display main reason y chose it.Nougat os and assured Oreo update from mm.Smooth touch n working condition.Camera front 16mp with flash doing good for more than the money given. Decent back cam with 13mp is better taking better than front under flash. Bokeh effect is ok but not equal to potrairt.Finger print is fast enough but 9/10 times accurate.Battery is good with 1 day assured backup for moderate use and 15-18hrs for heavy usage.Premium look and metal body, good to hold.Within 24hr service or replacement guarantee by mm.3gb ram with Snapdragon 425 1.4ghz ok for moderate games not for heavy games.No heat prblm till now.No hanging prblm till now after installing around 20 apps.CONS:No full HD screen only hd plus which is ok for this price.Speaker is not that much loud.Little heavy feel to hold which is habituated to use within a week.720 * 1440 pixels display is not playing not full screen videos in YouTube otherthan that camera video MX player n live TV playing full screen.App centre notifications not clearing untill we open that which is annoying.Go for it if your budget is under 10k.. recommended.	5
Good Phone at this budget.1st Time Micromax Sell a Good Product with All Satisfying Specifications.Good performance,good camera quality,good and large infinity display like Samsun,and battery performance be good.I definitely recommend for this phoneGuys Must Buy This phone.	5
Best phone but please companie service was not improved ur service center in shimoga, Karnataka.  they are not friendly behavior it is the major problem for costemers.	5
It a good phone according to price*even for 1.4 quad core snapdragon 425 processor  giving decent performance*good battery backup*feels sturdy*Avarage camera*lots of unique features*Fingerprint Sensor works perfectly & fast*Good displayIn this price its worth buying	5
Best phone guys becoz Rs9999 smart touch with full infinity display and 16mp selfi quality is 100 out of 100	5
Canvas Infinity is having infinite possibility and fully defining it's name, I am saying because it's being 5 days and still exploring new features of infinity.Due to its slim design and dark black screen its look awesome, all my colleges praise my decision of buying this phone.The 16mp Selfie camera takes awesome selfie, I had never seen before in this price segment.The phone screen is big to watch but the phone feels like small one.The brightness said in reviews were decent but I compared it with Redmi 4 and it was brighter than that, also the battery is good for more than 1 day of moderate useage. The charging time is approx 1 hr 45 min.	5
This phone is amazingSome youtuber says it have low battery but its not true battery backup is good.Display is amazingGaming is also variable or good	5
Liked it, could have been best with more battery capacity. I felt the touch sensitivity is little bit slow on the notifications on screen. Liked the camera features and photo quality. The infinity display could have been covering till the edges of the screen. Overall its a 4 stars product.	4
When I was order it. I didn't expect so much from it. But after using I have totally surprised from its performance. The major thing that surprised to me..it's good looking and no heating issues. Since it has different UI but  it doesn't lag and hang. Overall it is a very good work of MICROMAX TEAM.	5
Premium look.Camera is OK.Sound is clear but earphone sound is not up to mark. Earphone sound like ordinary earphone sound.Battery is OK according to 3000 Mah. if Chinese company gives 4000 Mah then they can't compare with this 3000 Mah.Not able to use in Sunlight.	4
The Phone is good with all specifications but a major problem observed is the Display Screen Resolution Issue while playing any game. The screen cannot adjust the overall in-game display. The screen display (Width-wise) cuts off at the edges of the phone. Even the game pages look congested. I have observed this issue as a major flaw in some games I play. The camera is really good for taking snapshots. The Oreo Android update as mentioned in upcoming updates for November is still not up-to-date. Still waiting for it to come. Hopefully awaiting the screen resolution issueOther than the above mentioned display screen resolution issue observed and the latest Android version still to come the phone has not shown any other issues.	3
Amazingly Best Phone ever!! Canvas Infinity is very light and sleek design made in India. Camera is best,Very Smooth grip and made of Good quality, received in Good condition using this no problem occurred, Best Product By Micromax India.	5
Superb Phone.I have bought it for me. Phone is very handy to use.  There Phone is look a like very good. And Yeah Main Features of PIP Camera and more than option also available inbuilt Camera and UI is not only better but Awesome Ui Of Micromax Canvas Infinity (Microma HS2) And Main Features Of this Mobile Phone's Screen Screen Ration is "18:9" means approxly 93% screen cover of display phone. Keep it Up. and don't more thank about buy this Mobile Phone.......  Just Close Eyes And Buy It.	5
After using this phone one month I write my review ..Looks very nice and standard ..nice mental body and easy to hold .Camera front is awesome 16 mp very nice and clear pic but back camera out of focus but ok can to take nice shot after adjust focus .Battery backup not day last long if u whole day net user u have to charge after 6 or 7 hours after but normal uses full day backup ..Processor is little bit slow compare my mi 4 but ok in 10 k price with infinity display and nice camera and most important don't buy chines phone support our indian brand bcos it's worth phone in 10 k ..in all parameters  .thanks ..	5
Good one but something missing like no application move to external sd cards. No fonts to display. No ram cleaning option.Home ui is copy from I phone. No return by Amazon.Thanking you.	3
Nice smart phone and experience is the best	4
better camera than mi4normal use battery 30 hours (include 6 hrs net surfing,2hrs video, )no heating issuenot for heavy gamersbest selfie camera in this range	5
Great Product from Home Grown Brand Micromax, My First Smart Phone was from this Brand Only, Purchased 1st Launch of Micromax Canvas 2 (A110) around 4 Years Back. Till date this phone works perfectly without any issue.Now Comes Review of Canvas Infinity :I was planning to change my phone to Vivo  / Oppo lastly settled with Full Vision Display Phone that cost under budget with lot of Features. i made the right choice after Buy in 1st Flash Sale on Amazon.Great Product from Micromax. Keep Going.	5
All things are good. List is large so it is not possible to mention here.Except:-1. It should have Gyroscope sensor2. It should have atleast 2 Ah charger.3. It should have better low light camera ( pixelation appears too much in low light).Thats all . If those will then definitely it will best phone of the year in india under 15k sub.	4
Yes it meet my expectation at 7700/- Rs it is was a great buy. But some times, it stop working for few minutes. Camera and touch is good. Overall at this price it is best. But Network band is not so good and in my home I am not getting any signal but other mobile I will get 2-3 bars of signal.	5
this is chinese phone.i feeling guilty after purchasing it.does not matter it have every thing that i need.i purchase this phone because i think it is Indian company but it is chinese product.if i not want Indian phone then i can buy other company phone.After this i think every Indian does not think about Indian phone company.	4
Good phone , good battery backup,  nice design. So many new features light  adaptive screen so back is very good .Leave oppo and vivo buy this value for money and they are providing 24/7 support if any faulty in phone. They called me and took the feedback and said if u find any fault we help u 24/7. Good service I suggest to buy it	5
3 days of use...Looks very good and stylish...Screen is big...Very handy...Can compete with LG Q6...But looks better than LG...	4
Very good phone in this price range, good camera quality, Nice interface..drawback are it don't have Gorilla glass, battery capacity, Processor speedMain thing is it was made by Indian company	5
Wow..... Beautiful and powerful handset from Micromax.GOOD PHONE WHICH IS WORTH EVEN 15K.	5
Its been 1 week since i am using this phone. I am using Micromax phone for the 1st time, I really had trust issues of MM. Still went ahead and purchased after a good research. For 10K, my personal opinion is, this is a good and almost a great phone in this budget. Performance wise its good. It doesn't get heated unlike other MM (my wife uses one, Canvas) / Lenovo K5 (my last phone) models. Camera is good; does a good job. This one may not be ideal for hard-core gamer's but when it comes to a normal gamer like me, i felt phone supports the games to great extend.Only draw back i felt was the audio quality which could have been improved a little more. Bcoz i felt lot of "sound" than audio quality. Not sure is it bcoz of the standard MM headset but thats one factor which i felt a little bad. Also return policy is not a fair one as Amazon wouldnt take it back in the event of any issues. But otherwise, its a nice phone for any who has only 10K budget and looking for a decent phone.	4
Camera capability is very good, even the night shots are marvellous as well, multitasking is just a breeze, I have played need for speed no limit continuously for two and a half hours the phone never showed any lagging being  just a HD display,  but working on split display mode is where 18:9 comes into play and i love this the most.  THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS SLOW CHARGING IT TOOK 2 HOURS TO CHARGE BUT WILL HAVE TO ADMIT BATTERY OPTIMIZATION IS VERY GOOD IT LASTS LONG VERY LONG	5
Its a very nice phone in this range!!Its approximately 1month since using itAnd i m not facing any kind of major problem with my handset.A true worth for money.Sometimes...fingerprint sensor doesn't work properlyBut its very rare...1/100th timesCamera is just awesome..Both front n back are very very good..The feautres i liked the most in Canvas infinity are...:*Mainly...Display....2.5D curved+18:9 display*Camera(13MP...16MP f-2.0)[Both rear and front flash]*OTG supporting*Internal memory(32GB)..[Expandable]*Dual sim(volte supporting)*Satisfying battery*Fingerprint sensorIts far better than LG Q6.The public is....behind...Xiaomi products...only....and ignoring these...best..indian companies...!!!Micromax is back in the race ..with this great phone....Loving the experience...and I want u also to have one....!!Surely...BUY IT...!!!!!!	5
Hi everybody I boght canvas infinity in it's 2nd sales. I bought this to encourage Indian products n to avoid China n other products. I never used any micromax phone before. This is first Indian phone I bought. Comparatively with other brands and in features, this is not good phone.Pros:Display is good, themes and colours are nice, front camera is very nice, light weight, finishing is very nice, battery life is good 6 hrs. Continuous 4g usage is successful.Con's:Slow processor, lags while switching screens even when no apps are open.Hangs frequentlyDoes't support all Indian languages properly, and some fonts.While sending SMS there is no multi contact selection.Some java programmes doesn't work.We cannot install some trading apps Luke Ventura wealth....Rear camera has no quality.Touch is slow.. My launcher is very worst, if u use other launchers like nova, noughat it works well.Dedicated apps like email, torch r missed. We can't move apps to external SD from internal memory.I think micromax didn't work welk while making this phone. Company has to release software updates to make success this phone. Otherwise patriotic people will look for other phones without nation's interest.	3
Review after using Micromax Infinity for more than a month.With the Chinese phones invading the Indian Market, I thought of supporting the Indian Manufacturer Micromax.I started trusting Micromax after purchasing a LED TV for a good deal.But there are 5 instances in these 2 months made me to regret for choosing Micromax Infinity. 1. The front camera response was damn slow during an office event made me embarrassing infront of others.. It took long time for processing the image. Had to hold my hand in same position after clicking the image. Sometime after 5 sec hold I took and the processed image was blurred. 2. One day, the touch screen became non-responsive and it was behaving weird. All of a sudden some random video from the Gallery will start playing. Had to remove the battery and reboot. Situation didn't repeat after that. 3. Earphones Issue : As soon as I connect my JBL earphones, it keeps on prompting for "Tap to Mute" & "Tap to Ring" not allowing me to access the Home screen or open Music app. I have to keep the music app ready before connecting earphone. 4. The Music app does not stop during Incoming call. I was riding my bike with music on from this phone. When I stopped I noticed 5 missed calls and it says it Rang 5 times and the music didn't even stopped. It was shocking for me. When connecting the headset it automatically goes to DND mode and calls are not notified. Atleast the Music should stop when the call lands your phone.. 5. The Finger print sensor is very slow and I have reposition my finger to access..Not sure all these above are tested during Phone Manufacturing.Still many Indians are ready to support Indian products please dont make them regret for their purchases.Suggestion : When I bought the 50 inch LED TV it was half the price of other big brands, I chose Micromax. When I wanted to support Micromax Infinity phone, there were many other options in the same price bracket and even lesser than 10K. Choice is yours	3
Revised review after 6months of usage:Phone is working absolutely fine and I am satisfied.  I got OTA update after which small hanging  problem (after data button turning ON) is gone. Good work by developers.Original review:One thing that is not mentioned anywhere is its SAR value. Its 0.294w/kg at head and 0.602 w/kg at body which is very much below accepted value of 1.6w/kg.Coming to the review: I have been using this phone from last 10-12days. Phone is good looking and performances of both camera's are good. As per other reviews already suggested go for this phone if you want general use like browsing, streaming, clicking pics & selfies :) Battery backup is satisfactory and lasts for a day with medium usage. But in return to bit lower battery capacity we get lighter and sleek looking phone :)18:9 screen size is a great USP of this phone and display is good.( I mean who goes to see PPI of the phone. 283ppi is close to retina display).Conclusion: Go for this phone without hesitation and any fear. My friends were smiling weirdly when they saw that I purchased Micromax phone. But after looking at the phone I didn't require any justification to be given to them ;) :)	5
This phone has everything, Front Camera is so nice that we fell that it's like a mirror. Only draw back is Battery, but still it is ok to survive for the day.In this range we cant expect more than this.Screen guard given is not a good quality, instead given tempered glass.There is a problem in Whats app, msg will be not received/delivered sometimes till we reboot the phone, micromax please look into this.	4
	5
Battery backup mast hai look s8+ ke jaiseSab kuch gajab hai value for moneyAur dehati bolu to le ke pachtaoge nahi bharosha karoBas thoda slow charging hai. Bass	5
Everything is good with this phone but disappointed with it's camera.Back camera is not too good if u want to click pictures in low light or in night...So little disappointed with this...	4
Very interesting mobile micromax canvas infinity is a very good product. I am felling better for used this mobile.This product is very well feauters in low price.This product  is comptiter ability compared to n another mobile in the market.thanku for all micromax canvas infinity service team.	5
Even 3gb ram mobile starts complete. Hanging when doing call bulk massaging	1
nice phone with outstanding camera  quality but there is whatsapp problem in this phone phone gets hang sometimes when you starts net and whatsapp message starts coming otherwise is is very nice phone with excellent camera (both front and back) with good battery backup	4
Micromax Canvas Infinity (Black, 18:9 FullVision Display)Yeah almost satisfied product for 10K and also 5.7 display but battery power is 2900 it could be better if battery power is above 3500 but still its not bad. go for it  it'sbest budget smartphone	4
Hi I purchase on 5th sept phone is good camera quality good front flash available but phone be hanged sometime	3
Best phone in this rangeWhy I pay 22000 for vivo 7When I got same features except 4 GB ram and 64 GB instead I get 3gb and 32And additional 18:9 display	5
After a week usage of the set,i can conclude the following points1) it's battery backup is good,for whole day usage.It went from 60% to 20% after a play session of about 2-3 hours.2) runs games at a pretty good speed,sometime u will see lags.But they are playable,this include all games.3) camera quality is average,dont expect much from both of the cameras.4) one thing I like is the screen.Its freaking awesome,watching HD film is a treat for me.5) buy this product for two reason I) it's an Indian product not made in India but the company is Indian. ii) screen.	5
Best phone of Micromax...Thank you Micromax...	5
Great come back by Micromax...Infinity is with excellent  16 mp camera, 5.7" screen, 3gb RAM, smart functions, sound quality, storage, light weight and it's within just Rs.9999. Just 2 things could have been better. One is processor n other is battery. To charge the phone it takes around 2.5 hours. But once charged it remains for 6-7 hours on avarage usage.Keep it up Micromax...	4
As expected. Best phone in this price range using it for last 2 weeks .no lagging problem .best phone for teen-agers not for heavy gamers .this phone enhances your personality everything is perfect in this mobile .best mobile by Micromax till date 	5
good  camara especially selfie. Battery back up is also fine average 1.5 days with dwell sim and wifi working continuously . Good phone in this range .	5
The phone does not connect calls!!! Can you believe it?!!!I got a replacement phone from Amazon after technician visit for the first defective phone and even the replacement phone does not connect calls!!!Incredible. Little wonder Chinese phone makers are sweeping the market.By the is Amazon selling refursbished phones as new??	1
Enjoying using the device.	5
Bahut hi shandaar mobile h...best mobile in this price range.....aur jo log bad review de rahe h wo chinese mobile k broker h.....be aware of chinese brokers.	5
A must buy smartphone if you are a selfie-addict. The 16mp front camera sensor is really a magic. The 13mp primary camera captures detail in such a way that it actually doesn't look like a below 10,000 variant. I will surely recommend this for students. If you are tech-spider and heavy user this phone is certainly not your best choice.	5
Best PhoneGood Camera both rear and front, fine touch scree, good battery back up, good processing speedAs per the mobile feature price is too good,Absolute worth product, a must buy, value for money	5
The phone looks great.  Works fluently. Great job by Micromax.Just two things are lacking :1. Rear camera quality is not good.2. Direct Video call feature is not available.Otherwise  worth buying it.	4
Overall working is good (after 5 and half month of uses).....(4.2/5)No heating problem.No lags.Camera quality is good (front 4.5/5 and back 4.0/5).Internet speed is too good!!! (4.7/5).Battery life still good - on normal to heavy internet uses (3.5/5).Display is good but not as advertised.....it's average (3.8/5).One can go for it!!!..... recommended strongly!!!....Abhi tak iss mobile ne dukh nhi Diya....lagta hai Lamba saath nibhayega!!!	5
Hello to all i purchased this mobile from amazon for my dad i just download wt s up and now mobile storage showing is full infect non of function are working mobile showing device is full kindly help me 9785334612	1
Hello, I am writing this review after one month use of Micromax Canvas Infinity (Black). I bought it @ 8499/- specially because of INDIAN Brand, but it is a 'Made in China' product.NICE: Camera, Touch, Battery and Display.The phone is Good and I am happy and satisfied with my decision to buy it and its performance. The phone doesn't hang and no heating or very minor heating is observed. Camera is good in day light specially front camera though low light shots were not as nice as it should be. No blot-wares were installed during use and the phone updated three times during this time ??? (I don't know what was the update for).DISLIKE:The phone falls very short (on my expectation) on user interface, though it has a clean and simple interface. I found issues and lack of even basic features in interface though it might overcome in future updates.But the bottom line is Micromax Infinity is Good phone and will not disappoint you if you go for it, but you'll be missing some of the basis user features in its interface.	4
Awesome phone.After using it for 10 days I feel why people are wasting money in Vivi v7& v7+ wherein this phone comes with infinity display with premium metallic look. If I talk about performance the phone didn't lag at all while multitasking as well as while playing games. Battery could have been better like 3500 Mah or so but still gives 8 yours heavy usage on 4g network. Amazing phone. Thanks Amazon and Micromax for such an amazing phone.	5
1st time i am satisfied with this smartphone i have purchased lot of smartphones but micromax infinity is totally impressed me and i love itbest part of this phone is display and camera excellentfront camera amazing better than other smartphone in this prize rangeno heating issue, display feel like royalstorage and ram awesomei mean one word review= excellent	5
Great Indian phone but all parts made in china.searching a name in contacts getting multiple name, For ex. If I have 'Ganesh.s' in my contact list then when I type Ganesh.s it's show triple entries in the search list. In-fact I've selected the contacts to display as PHONE CONTACT ONLY. All settings done properly, but still unable to merge the contacts. It's show no contacts to merge. Micromax team please update on this.	5
This handset have hanging problem please don't buy this	1
Its a mixed bag. The things I like about it is the screen ratio, slim form factor and battery life.Things I don't like is the pushing of ads. Its irritating. And apps get cut or shrunk due to display form factor. And at times the phone freezes. Micromax still hasn't figured out software optimization. The hardware isn't great. Snapdragon 425 is a below average CPU. Not good for gaming. Sound output via speakers are OK, but not up to mark via 3.5 mm audio jack.And 16mp front facing camera is just for sake of numbers. What will the pixels do if the optics are mediocre. I have seen many low megapixel cameras do a great job than this. Requires lot of light for good snaps.	3
Good phone. Specifications mentioned in the site are as given. I am still checking out the features.Cons - (features I found missing)1. No options found to customize the contacts displayed.2. Only one single phone profile available. No profile settings like Silent, Meeting, Outside etc. found. You have to change individually any options required for the situation.	4
Excellent mobile... Super display...... Camera best for oru money.. video play gud.... Audio quality ok........	5
I got this pbone on 10th sep 2017 from amazon and have been using it from past 2 days. I would must say that this is best phone in the market in the price range of Rs 10000 .Here are some things which i liked in canvas infinity-1. The 16 MP front facing camera is taking very good pictures.2. The display quality is very good and the phone look very beautiful with this 18:9 ratio scree.3. The latest Android version 7.1.2 make it bater.4 . Phone runs smoothly with 3 GB ram.5. We can also use micro SD card along with two sim cards.My overall experience for this phone is very good.I would recommend this phone to everyone who want a phone in Rs 10000 price range.	5
Using this phone since 1 month and faced a couple of problems like . Many a times phone screen shows playing tone and it's  arise anytime when playing video using Whatsapp etc I hate it literally it bothers me too much . I want this problem to be solved when switch on this phone it doesn't recognize my password instantly even if the password is correct . I  have to wait for at least 5 min then only it accept my password and i can't use my fingerprints to unlock this phone after switching on other wise fingerprint scanner is working . And talking about the battery it usually drains after 1.5 day for normal users and when I charged it fully 100% battery drains quickly . It doesn't show wifi linking speed on the screen . And it doesn't have note making app in this phone like mi is having .  The temper which comes with delivery is of very low quality . There is no use of Appcentre in this mobile when we can use Google play store to download apps . Appcentre only provides us with  a couple of apps not of our choice and it install apps  in the phone without asking the user which the user have to uninstall and notification of this Appcentre doesn't remove from my screen even if I swap I only have to open up all the notification of Appcentre to close them even after I had silenced the notification of this app and it doesn't shows my lock screen wallpaper which is very disappointing . camera works perfectly it pretty good but it is not having bokeh effect which is written in it's description overall the phone is good I am satisfied . I got Amazon gift card worth rupees 50 which could be used to purchase anything but, I recharged my mobile and got a cash back of rupees 25. Because I ordered my phone in offer period of which I was unaware so it was gift for me from Amazon on Valentine's day 	5
A great phone below 10k . The snapdragon processor is old but still you can run pretty much every game on this phone with minimal heating isues. The camera is great too.	5
Honestly saying that... Go for it... Literally m well satisfied with this mobile....My friends always suggest me to wait for redmi 5 but now I feel that my decision to purchase infinity mobile  is osm...I feel that m using iphone inside phone...Due to XOS operating system..Battery backup for those whose internet is  always on and constantly surfing whole the day is about 12 hoursNormal users sometimes keep net off can standby whole day...Sound osmA very best thing about this phone ..It's not heating at all as other even after playing heavy games like asphalt 8 and no laggingCharging time is 3 hours or less approx and 100 approx mins. In switch off condition.Yaa you can say only one thing that is touch compatibility is bit lower then redmi...Touch sensitivity bit low...So starting m thodi problm hoti thi type krne m..But this is not a big issue...no problm at op...1.5 gb ram free rhti h26 gb something storage free rhta hPortrait mode on both selfie and real camera...Camera really awesome....M pure din bus camera camera and cameraThanksOr kuch janna ho...To puch lena...	5
I have been using this for quite sometime. Initially this was the best phone, but somehow now its gotten slower, getting heated so much faster, and the charging I have do it twice in a day for medium use. Otherwise the photo quality and interface is gud. i definitely recommend for a cheap buy and medium use. not for heavy smart phone use.	4
Wish I could rate this bad as I suffered. I am Debadatta Shankhua, from Bangalore. I am using this phone since Sept 2017 and I regret I didn't go for MI phones. Got this @ INR 9630.00 but not upto the quality what I thought it would be. So many issues with this phone. Having said that this phone has so many issues, please don't buy this. Go for MI phones. Value your money and your hard work.Hope this would help you before you go for this one.	1
I ordered this product thinking about made in india.  But i am totally dissapointed by seeing the package, battery and mobile as made in china. Phone also heating much and speed is not like 3gb.  I personally will not encourage others and its not made in india	1
Great phone but some time fingerprint not working properly and battery backup improve required	4
I bought this phone at mid 2017.And I didn't expected a phone to give so many features (totally new) at such a great price.	5
Looks good but works badIt's just 4 days since I purchased this frustrated with its performance.Internet is not connecting. I removed the sim and tested the same sim to other device then it is working. Wasted money on this.Worst product.	2
Pros1. Looks Premium2. Awesome Camera3. Light Weight 160g4. SLIM 8MM5. Simple and easy user interface6. Battery.Cons1. Processer	5
I bought it on 22 Sep for 9999. The quality is good.. you will get a silicon cover in box. I like this phone. Has a better front cam than a rear cam. The quality is sober. Very good in this range. Plus it has very gr8 ambient to use.The screen is curved. Has 18:9 ratio.So far so good..Loved it.	4
Third class product as well as service, Screen was broken and mobile was just fall down from 6" height and it screen was broke, Some time hang but the worst part is service i called to micromax and visit service station four time no body is there to revert every time they told come tomorrow final i met the person  and they are bluntly told all is chargeable but it is under warranty.	1
All new innovation super and wroth for money.Only battery while using internet charge will reduced.Compare other equal price phone micromax is very good.	5
Good PerformanceGreat Screen Viewing ExperienceGood Battery BackupGreat looksGreat price rangeGood Camera quality Front Camera flash is great for night selfiesOverall 4/5 must buy in budget of 10k	5
Dual sim,  decent cameras , separate memory card slot, 18:9 fast touch screen , value for money	5
Don't buy this mobile,its like toy available in fair with all extraordinary future which runs only for 1 month. Fully wasted moneyI think they have launched this by directly manufacturing without any testing features for money making.They are making us fool.Daily I have to switch off and on at least 2 times if display,many apps not works.	1
Front camera is really good, runs smooth but battary backup is not good at all only 1 hour of gaming and normal use will drain the whole battary before the day ends. No heating issue but the fingerprint sensor suddenly stops working then I have to restart the phone and after that it starts working again. Now after 3-4 months of use it has a display problem there is yellow colour patch on the top left corner which can be seen whenever there is a white background or light colour background which is pretty annoying even though it has a low price but atleast this is not what I wanted to happen.	4
Nice to see Micromax getting innovative. It's a quality phone with features packed at this price. Recieved the phone today and haven't used it all day long in context of the battery sustainment. Overall a nice package and might give tough competition to its rivals.	5
It's a fabulous phone excellent camera and screen it's soooooooooo good and the sound is quality is soooooooooo nice	5
Micromax CEO promised for Oreo in this Smartphone but till not available....Thanks for giving us infinity. but if you give in Octacore ..that should be a great smartphone...a stone mile for Micromax company	5
One of the best Micromax phone. Infinity display at just 9999 wow, performance is average but good smartphone and good service of Amazon.	5
Bought Micromax for d first time after going through so many reviews on YouTube... But I must say it is totally worth it for the price... Awesome camera quality... Awesome phn and display... I heard on YouTube about it's speaker output is a bit low but it is not that low... Great value for money product... Must buy in this price range...	5
Im writing this after a year. The phone works good , main problem is that it takes much more time to recharge the battery now than before. Also the charger is making problems but I used a different charger and now all works good.This phone is now more awesome with this new update	5
Those who want to buy a mobile under 10k can go for it. As per its price, It will not disappoint u in performance. Indian brand but made in China(manufactured). But it's not a China Mobile. #INDIANwillBUYit	5
Purchased on 12/09/2017 ,nice packaging,fast delivery,canvas infinity nice phone ,nice camera,everthing is fine in this 9999 price tag	4
It's looking good, I used very smoothly. It's battery back up is one day and camera in good quality. Overall features in cool. Superb Mobile...	4
I was under a very good opinion about Micromax  mobile phones. But it's very  unfortunate that the efficiency of the mobile which I have received is very very very poor. I want to exchange - but I have received it exactly a month back i.e., 22.09.2017. can I go for exchange or return of this product please.....?	1
1. Best looking smartphone2. Display is good and clear3. Camera is owesome cant get better in this price segment4.battery is only 2950 mah but blive me it behaves as if it is more tha 4000 mah, battery will surely impress you.5. Dedicated memory card slot6. Removable battery7. No heating problem at allOnly problem with it is that display is not protected. You have to take care and finger print sensor work good 9/10 times.	5
Android Nougat is not at par with my previous phone's cyanogen OS. At least half a second lag in response. Downloaded the latest upgrade but still the same. Camera quality is OK. File manager app that I installed from play store is unable to move or delete files. App permission issue. Doesn't show which permission required. Tried by providing all access from app management, but such a versatile app is not allowed on my phone. Somebody please suggest a way out.	3
Everything is good, the look is amazing. It is a revolution in the history of Micromax.The only issue is the camera, which is not up to the mark as far as the declared camera quality is concerned which is 13 and 16 MP camera.Although the camera is fine.The front look is literally amazing.	4
Good phone in this price range. Suited for normal day to day usage.Goods:1.Large screen suited for watching HD movies.2.Battery lasts more than a day with moderate usage.3.Performance is as expected, no lags while playing heavy games like Asphalt84.Dedicated memory and 4G sim slots, and also removable battery.5.Overall look and feel is premium.I have taken out one star cause :1. Takes more time to charge, takes around 3 hours to charge from 20%-100%. expected a fast charger.2.The screen display is not so crisp and sharp. Though you cant make out unless you have used premium mobiles.3. Edit- Fragile screen with no gorilla glass. Screen shattered the first time it fell.	3
Best mobile phone. Both front and back camera s are amazing. Super pixel feature is wonderful in capturing minute details. It brought back my hobby of photography. Fingerprint sensor fast ram removable battery separate memory slot infinity display are wonderful. Screen is cool on my eyes. One handed operations are easy Hindi writting app is not good. No fast charging.ibut over all good satisfactory performance	5
I bought this one a month ago..There are soo many issues with this mobile,when you tries to call someone,mobile screen automatically gets locked and its not at all responding till we disconnects the call..Only Battery backup is good.I thought that i will get the best mobile,But i didn't.Very disappointed.	2
Phone looks gud only in outward appearance.Call quality (the basic function of a mobile) not gud. Inaudible and mumbled voice output on earphones. Tried different earphones but result always same. Front camera quality okay but main camera poor quality which is even worsen by poor quality display. Don't go for it coz better phones available in this range. Even one year old Lenovo k6 is working better than this. Buttons on display not as gud in operation as advertised.	1
Really,the screen and the touch is fabulous,graphics intelligent and a very accurated android makes the phone eye-catching.a great mobile for India.No heating,charging time is 45-60 min,camera is awesome	5
I liked this phone very much...it's almost similar to Samsung j7 Max...then y pay extra...go for this phone. Camera clarity is good.it also looks biguser friendly...	5
HORRIBLE PHONE...THE PHONE IS DEAD IN JUST 3 MONTHS.CUSTOMER CARE IS HORRIBLE.MICROMAX COMPANY MUST BE BANNED.ITS A FRAUD COMPANY.	1
It's a good product and value for money as compared to vivo and other infinity display phones but sometimes it give continuous alerts of messages message app is not working properly	4
I would say that It Good Phone in 10k range. I am sharing my experiences of this phone.Memory: It is giving on 22GB for storage (10 GB used by systems)Processor(Speed): Speed is very good.Battery: Wifi(32Hrs), With mobile internet(25 Hrs),Display : Display is best in 10k range phone(You can face some touch issues)Camera: Front Camera is good not best event it is 16MP and 13MP.	4
After using for 1monthHardware - 4of5 star (it is premium/steady)  Droped the phone from shoulder hight withot back case and was surprised to see the phone survived without any dent or damaged screen..Software - 2.5of5 star (integration could b better)  This phone is a best buy for normal user  As it lags a little while multi taskingBattery - 4of5 star (survive a day even if the internet is on)  4of5 star (charging time from 0to100% 2-3 hrs approx)Sound - 4of5 star (loud/clear)Vibration - 4of5 star (moderate)Voice call quality - 4.5of5 star (clear)Network - 4.5of5 star (no network issue)Earphone - 3of5 star (music)  2of5 star (for call as the voice is to sharp)Camera - 5of5 star (front is awesome)  4of5 star (rear is good)	4
Good and reasonable.... i like itthnq for amazing deal ..	4
9499/-Lightweight, Decent phone with superior handling. Display and cameras are 4/5Battery is 3.5/5VFM is 5/5	4
Its a perfect phone in 10k range. i am using this device from 6 days.In review many people criticized it for low processor.But its working well as i can play Asphalt fluently.Both the cameras are ok.No preinstalled useless apps.You can even uninstall some of the preinstalled Apps.Look is cool.Its handy!!!!! And in last there is ok type Earbud,Back cover and tempered glass provided with the pack.Overall a wonderful product by Micromax.	5
Not the greatest phone but great value for money.Build quality is gorgeous. It gives off an expensive taste of a high end phone even though it's nowhere near the price. It doesn't have a gorilla glass on front so If you don't case this phone immediately you will regret it.Phone's performance is smooth and makes it worth the price. I use my phone as a phone and I don't use it for gaming. It's smooth as butter for the tasks I use it for.Camera quality is good enough.The phone's also got some drawbacks... There is tons of bloatware as to be expected. A good chunk of them are uninstallable. The speaker is not quite loud and finger print sensor refuses to work sometimes.That's all I have for now. So far so good. Great for those who are not big on special brands.But as it stands I'd rate this phone a solid 4/5.Size is great; screen is nice, Very small bezel, Battery lasts fine... try it.	4
great phone for this cost... Micromax comes back with a bang..... I love my phone... great Micromax keep it up.. good going guys...	5
Fantastic cellphone with 10k prize.Front camera is good...Back camera is ok..Battery is good...Fingerprint sensor response is very good..Display is also nice...GUI is ok..No facility to dial video call directly.. you need to install Apps for video call...Sound and speaker is good... Speaker is sometimes bit loud...Gaming is average...One disappointing thing is, It has written "Made in china" (hence given 4 star)... Being an Indian company, Micromax should manufactur the phones in India...Overall good product by Micromax....	4
Nice phone, Nice camera  and good battery backup but sometimes while during in videocalling my battery percentage has quickly down and otherwise all are very good with packing and I m satisfied with Canvas Infinity than Infocus Vision 3#Well Thanks Amazon	4
good phone......worth money.....impressed.......#not impressed with its camera....rest all salient features are awe	5
This mobile is really so good. A very large and clear display. Battery life is so good and with stand for 2 days even for full internet and call usage. Very handy with Android 7 look so good user interface and icons. Really value for money.	5
Awesome phone.. display quality superbGreat work on phone fantastic ... value for money ...and for battery life 5 star out of 5..Battery life superb.... INDIAN ' company rocks	5
Awesome Product. It is a nice product with the price. Nobody gives you this specification at this Price. One main drawback is that charging time is more than other devices.	5
Great Value. Good camera screen speakers. Micromax has definitely nailed it.I use this as my primary phone over my iphone 7 now	5
Guys,I don't usually write reviews. But, for the guys who are saying that they are facing lag issues & hang problem-- Please disable the Magnification Gesture. And any other gesture which you might have enabled at the phone startup.Your problem will go away !Cheers.Only front camera is good though. Rear camera quality not that good. But works for 9999 range.	5
Not good to buy... incoming voice problem, automatic switchoff and hanging problem also. I bought on 22 January 2018 and it's only 2 month and so many issues.	1
Nice phoneNo hang no heatingGreat touch and cameraNice fingerprintGood battery backupOnly problem is that can't find tempered glass of this model which perfectly fits it.Overall a nice phone	4
After 3 days of usage, I would say it's a great mobile from Micromax. My review based on usage is...Pros:Premium look & build qualityFront camera is goodNo lagging issue till nowBattery lasts for 1 day after moderate useProcessing speed is averageCons:Portrait games display is been cut from d sides, it's bcoz of 5.7 inch sizeBack camera worst	4
Back camera is not good it's like 5mp. I see grains in the screen. Front camera is good. Phone is s good phone. It's fast, better quality, battery n slim. Looks nice. Sound quality is also good. Supports 2 Sims n SD card at the same time. Fingerprint scanner s fast.	3
Very good phone...I love phone size and screen. Screen is very bright and can view in sunlight also.--UI is good.--Battery last for day.. good--I load many apps to Chech processing... Found good.--i don't play games..so not loaded any.--Camera pixel is good. But it doesn't cancel light ray in picture.  I think there it has an issue.Check photo attached.	3
Awesome mobileVery good camera and soundqualityAnd good battery backup	5
After using it for one month am writing this review...Please don't buy it, there are so many draw backs that I have found while using...1) Internet connection is very poor while connected to mobile data, it shows the connection but there is internet access.2) Very poor screen quality, although it's not a gorilla screen but they should have given better one. There are few lines visible in the background of the screen when it is locked.3) The call is automatically getting disconnected while talking.this is not because of signal, it is purely mobile fault.4) camera quality and battery backup is OK.	2
I bought this after much research, and with some trepidation since I had never bought a Micromax product before. I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, Amazon was pretty quick in delivery. But the phone per se blew me away for the kind of price tag it came with. It packs quite a punch in almost all departments, and is real value for money. I write this after a week's usage. I use the phone largely for calling, surfing the net, messaging,  listening to music, watching videos, but not for gaming. The display may not be 100% edge-to-edge but it is far superior to those of normal phones. I bought the phone only because of the bezel-less display & I was not disappointed. Despite buyers cautioning about poor battery life and some lag, with my kind of middle-to-light usage, the battery lasts as much as 3 days. Even if you are a heavy user, I suspect it will last well over a day. There's an interesting battery-saver feature which kicks in when battery is at 15%, after that, battery lasts even longer till it dies out. The widgets may be rather small but you get used to it. Its also got the latest Android version so need for any updates. There's complete ease of use. The glass is not Gorilla and I think that's a drawback but according to me, the only one. I did play some basic games on it and there was no lag at all, despite reviewers saying so. Maybe, the lag is noticeable in the high-end games, I don't know. For the price tag it comes with, this one is quite the thing.	4
This handset is most worst handest i perched from amazon. The day i received it, on that same day it  it got hunged for 3 times,  it started getting hanged everyday, cant complit the calls & it get hot too much, which is so poor quality product. Called Amazon, they sent technician, which is most unqualified person, as per him the hanset is ok, as he left, the handset got hannged for the 3 times, called again Amazon, they say, they cant return it, & suggest to visit the Micromax service center & get repair. This is the most  third grade service Amazon give & sell such third grade product. Its zero value for money, zero corporative support  from Amazon & now its only work left, to go to service centre & take the again yuk reply. I need to return this third grade handset & want my money back. Never buy, Micromax and any products from Amazon.	1
So where shall I start ..hmmIt's almost 10 months since I have been using this phone. I must say I have had no issues whatsoever.So let's go detail by detailsThe display is really good. And the back camera is really clear at 13 mp and front camera with flash is also awesome with 16 mpNow the battery has gone down a bit in performance after almost 9 months but I have been using heavily the internet with games like ( COC, Dominations, Candy crush,etc..)and lots of software too still the battery lasts a whole day.. if under used the battery last more than a whole day almost 24 hrs and more.I have uploaded a picture taken from the rear camera to give u an idea of clarityAmazon was quick in it's delivery and I was impressed.Sound vice it lacks a punch but with headphones it's great.I love this phone for this low budget I hope it keeps going for another year.Not bad given 3 GB ram and 32 gb space inbuilt with upgrade availability to 128 gbBut the one main con is that it has no fast charge which means once fully down it takes nearly 2 hrs to get fully charged that's the one drawbackOverall Happy customer with this Indian phone lives up to the price	4
The breadth of the phone is too small on the lenght is big phone with 4 inch screen have bigger length than this one.only the features are good.	3
Superb camera quality.. better than others mi vivo in this range... Better than note 4 also.. little bit hang when net turn on.. go for it.. awesome display quality like S8.	4
Guys nothing much , but in 10000 the best mobile i can say because i m also using the mobile from last 3 months and fully satishfied with this mobile . Really appreciable.	5
Amazing product by Micromax.. something different from what is available in the mobile market..	5
Worst phone I had ever used in my life , in just 5 days its screen was not working bad touch and lay in notification bar low quality things are used to make this phone,that's why it is very cheap too much of lags, bad fingerprint sensor "beckaaar"	1
i like this phoneit got 18:9 ratio screen which is good in this range  camera of the phone is also goodthe most surprising this about this phone is the phone battery which is 2900mah but i thought it work of 4000mah battery i got 2days backup with heavy use of itif u want phone In this Budget range then just go for iti hope u like the phone	4
Gifted to my dad... he loved it ... screen is big... quality of the screen is little low compared with Samsung... but all the other features are awesome... at this price range it might be the best phone for you... !!!	5
I ordered this Micromax Canvas Infinity as a gift for my son who was entering his teens. The delivery was prompt and arrived as scheduled. But when my son opened the phone after I gifted it to him, It didn't start. Assuming that the battery must have been completely drained I connected it to the charger.and to my surprise the phone didn't charge beyond 50% stage. To top it it just switched off when disconnected the charger.MY WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS PURCHASE DEFEATED...	1
This phone is awesome with any angle.Display is attractive. Camera is awesome at this price. Battery is also good.Truly very happy with is phone...	5
The product is not what you get. Not because of Amazon, but Micromax. The picture they advitise is not the actual phone..it has big besal and it's no where related to infinity display.Also poor quality. After using it for 8-9 months, I had to take it to service centre for two manufacturing defects. I'm going to change the phone since it is again showing issues.It will work ok for 1month if you are lucky.	1
realy nice super i like it...mi note 4 se acha he.no heating proble  enjoye gameing	5
Phone is good... But just after 2days the fingerprint sensor stopped working. If I restart the mobile then it works for few times & again stops working. I am not sure that this issue is only with my mobile or with every mobile set. Rest of the things are good. I would have given 5star if the fingerprint sensor issue was not there.	3
This product so many option not there (example -volt enable option not in mobile. only available Lte enable option )than this mention 5.7 inch but really not this size ,Than,finger print not properly work very slow. specification ?Return Policy show but when we use return option this not accept our request not process	2
Value for money product, can't find any problem till the date	5
Nice phone verry good but cover and glass not avilabal in shope	4
Good budget phone at this price. Everything is quite nice. Just it takes too much time for charging but good battery backup. Phone is for moderate users. Screen, picture quality and touch quality is quite nice u won't be disappointed with this phone. Selfi camera is owsome but rear camera is not so impressive.	4
Good screen quality also the camera is goodProcessor must need to improveLooks premium in hand nice designI am not a hard core gamer so it feels good for me can't expect more in 10 K	4
best phoneboth cameras are awesomebetter than redmi, oppo and vivo	5
Simply awesome product from Micromax...will suggest Micromax to bring such innovative products rather than rebranding product...all the way it look such a premium product with brilliant front camera quality and all... next product should be dual camera and 4mah battery obviously 6inc in 18:9 aspect ratio which will killer product	5
I am the owner of tech channel on YouTube. My channel's name is ihax.inc. you can check it out. So, I bought this phone on the first sale and I have used this product for 2 weeks i guess. First of all i would like to say that the look of this phone is amazing. It feels very handy and best to be fit in your pockets. Screen is quite impressive. I have faced some also like hearing, sometime fingerprint scanner are not working, notification light not working properly for messages and one handed mode out of 1/10 times didn't work properly. But i guess the future update these problems will be sorted out. I got a call from micromax today to tell about them the pros and cons of this phone. The split screen feature is awesome, 3 finger swipe screenshot always work properly, long screenshot feature also work well, tha cam performance is good, the cam modes are really good. Speaker quality is also good. I didn't face any lagging issues till now all the apps are working properly but sometimes Instagram crashes but this might be the problem in the app itself. For average daily use battery stays whole day after full charge but if you are constantly using the phone the battery will drain out withing 6-7hours.  At last the overall performance of this phone is  good and if you are thinking to buy this phone then surely go for it. And do check my channel on YouTube.	4
Excellent phone with great features n with latest Android version. And the hardware is ready for next Android version. So you don't need to change phone for using new Android version. Excellent cameras n large screen will definitely change experience of using Android phones. Really a revolutionary phone at great price.	5
Very goood phone in this price range .No hangingSmooth performanceGood multitasking capabilityBest display	5
Awesome, amazing, fantastic product... The product is same as it is shown and the features too... Who ever are willing to buy it u just go for it cause such featured mobile nd in this cost is truly amazing... Thanks a lot amazon for this i just loved it.. At the it's very first the charging of the battery was little slow... But as now m using it charges early and also the charge retains.. Camera is damn awesome... The clarity of camera is so awesome...	5
Very disappointed with this product. I got a defective product and when i talked to customer care executive, they said they will send technician for verification, then product will be replaced or returned....	1
wonderful  mobile. i am getting  backup  more than expected. Stylish  mobile	5
Best phone which excels in most of the required parameters; design, display, performance, camera, battery backup in every fields it maintains a special quality which make it different from others.Don't give your ear to negatives, because they think negatively.It's a ground breaking piece in the Indian Smart phones market.You can get the battery backup for minimum two day of normal use.The design is great, it gives us a something different look.Thank you	5
Worst phone ever ...battery guzzler..irritable user interface...complexiety is more..many preinstalled ...camera is always on without u knowing it...got inbuilt pm modi app which does not go even if u want to delete it..	1
This mobile is super ultimate.. I am just in love with this mobile. At such a nominal price, you are getting awesome features what else you need....If anyone is looking for a budget mobile with such an amazing features, go ahead and blindly buy this mobile... You will be never regretting to buy this mobile....	5

Earlier I was using Micromax unite. Keeping this in mind, I thought of purchasing Canvas infinity, a higher version. Of course, with a compatriot's angle I did so. But it is not at all up to my expectations. Finger sensor is poor, so are some features. Sometimes the touch screen is not working properly. The features are not user-friendly. A person new to it finds difficult to use it. I thought it would be easier as I had Micromax model earlier but this Canvas infinity is different.	1
Pros- Great value for money- Camera quality is very good- Battery backup is also very good- Device performance is OK.- Display is good- Sound output is descent- Finger print performance is average- Look and feel of this device is goodCons- No fast charging support Overall this product is worth to buy at this price.	5
Received on 11th September great packing, super mobile with bezeless display, average battery one day battery backup, might have given 4000mah like MI phones other things great gives full ***** stars, except battery performance *** stars, lowest price but like Samsung. S8 display, butter smooth touch response.....great...thanks Micromax with super full vision display and Make in India mobile	5
I'm pleased with this product. In this price segment this phone holds much better performance. But the screen protector which has come in the box is not a good one but except this all is okay till now. Most important thing is that the front side and back side camera are perfect. Touch and fingerprint sensor is very responsive. no cons cz I hv not faced any in this phone. Good job Micromax. U can go for it surely.	5
WORST PRODUCTPoor Quality, Received defective product, Both the SIM cards are not detecting, Called Amazon, they are telling there is no Refund policy, I am just fighting with them...Never ever buy a product from AMAZONTHEY WANT TO CHEAT CUSTOMERS IN THE NAME OF POLICY....	1
superb phone camra quality is so good ...long battery backup totally good thax micromax good service by Amazon	5
Overall ok phone in this price range. Display is good but design is totally different as per image. It's not look like infinity phone only name is infinity. Otherwise features is good in this price. Battery capacity is low as per features. Display take too much battery .	3
Great mobile in this budget, good build quality, premium look, good full vision display with 18:9 ratio, good speakers.16 and 13 MP camera with real time bokeh effect is just aweome.	5
This a perfect mobile phone in this range.At the comparison of other phone like Nokia... Infinity made a boom.Specification of this mobile a better than Nokia because in this range it gave me everything which I want..so be thankfull to Micromax for build this mobile...	5
Looks, usage, UI, features all good..loved the mobile ...a good product in this range .	5
Nice and advanced product.	5
Worst phone  I have ever experience.Ui is slower than snail.camera is good.but performance wise it is worst	1
It's just been one day..working fine so far.battery is not really that big issue here.though the camera is good decent enough time lapse good..features looks are amazing..feels like iPhone x.. overall good.. Amazon app is hanging..let's see what happens tomorrow	3
Both sim slots are not detecting SIMspl take back product.and replace new one.Contact me	1
it lags a bit other wise this is complete bang for buks.also they have a interface like iphone ( completely depend on person to person perspective ) you might like it or not like it.	4
Great phone of this cost....	4
It is awesome smartphone in this range. Front camera quality is excellent and rear camera quality is good. Awesome screen 5.7 inch with ratio 18:9 without increase mobile size. Performing is also excellent with snapdragon processor and latest nougat android operating system upgradable with Oreo. Battery is enough for one day use for normal user but I feel not sufficient online user and gaming user.Overall Micromax done job excellent in this prize (Rs. 9,999) segment.Everyone should purchase this phone which want all in one in a smartphone.	5
I am writing this review after using this phone for 2 months.I love the phone and quality of both front and back camera's are very good it's fingerprint sensor also work good no issues right now  , it heats a little bit while playing games but it's ok but it gets little bit laggy when we turn on the internet but as compared to other phones in this price range it is better, it's infinity display actually gives a nice experience while playing games I can comfortably play Gangster Vegas which is approximatly 1.88gb game (after extracting) no issues. It has many sensors in the app called Smart kit 360 you can use every instrument in it.	5
Best selfies phone under 10000rs	5
Everything looks good, except Camera(Both). I have used Micromax Canvas earlier and it has 8 MP and i compared both and my old mobile is far better than the this.Performance is excellent, little heating while playing games and while charging.Full display is awesome with touch.Returned the product due to Camera issue. No Stock to replace now.	3
It's good phone but while playing music continues for 2hrs it start heating . That's why i am not happy with this product & when we take pic from normal camera and when i zoom that pic the pic starts getting blur & when we take pic while zooming the pic is not clear.	2
I will just say that Micromax has done a excellent  job by launching this infinity series...you won't get a good phone in this price range..the phone is really very user friendly and it's very good..You will get a different feeling while using this phone...the front camera is too good for selfies and primary camera is also very good..the ram management is also good.Overall I will just say that this is the best budget phone which I bundled with almost everything you need in your daily life..Good work guys @micromax India	5
Got my phone on 9dec. Satisfied with Amazon Delivery.Talking about phone. This is good phone in this price range. Good camera. Over all Buil Quality is good, But it's take too much time to charge this phone. That's one issue I had found that. Some heating problem.	4
I suggest to not buy because of heating problem and speaker and also screen colour was bad effect	1
Good mobile at the price of 9500/- but yes still need somethings to improve. Like notification panel is lacking. Finger print sensor only work 5 time out of 10. Back panel is having issue of finger prints on it so i had to laminate it.Camera is good, more than average. Speed is good. Screen quality is nice. Overall look is attractive and strong.	4
The phone goes way back with our fingers...hehe.just work on the camera and u are there	5
good product	5
This mobile is really so good. A very large and clear display. Battery life is so good and with stand for 2 days even for full internet and call usage. Very handy with Android 7 look so good user interface and icons. Really value for money.	4
It's OK. But the screen protector which came with the pack is smaller than the screen of the phone. And the phone has a mind of its own sometimes - it goes into refusal mode. I have to wait a while then give the commands. Processor seems a bit slow too. My spouse has a Lenovo K8 plus which is much better. Even the sound quality of Micromax is not so good.	3
It has a good design, Full screen visual, superb for selfie, battery back-up is nice. It's handy to carry.It would be better if the screen resolution is Full hd and processor of new version of snapdragon.Overall happy with the phone...	5
TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY. FINALLY GOT EVERYTHING IN SMALL PACKAGE OF JUST RS.9999/-.WITH AWESOME CAMERA FEATURES AND DISPLAY QUALITY IS REALLY "WOW"	5
Totally disappointed.	1
Very poor performance. I am extremely disappointed with this product as the only reason I bought this is cos its an Indian brand and wanted to promote it.	1
Very nice	5
Micromax really you did awesome work on canvas infinity.Really it's awesome phone	5
Very good phone and good utilazition of . Screen, battery and processor are amazing.	5
It's a good phone in the budget but some cons like ui is lagging a bit rear camera not as much as expected battery not so much efficient earphones out put of audio is bit unsatisfactory fingerprint is not so much accurate pros are screen ratio viewing angle is good build quality is premium.	3
I was using Micromax Canvas Nitro phone for the past three years without any issues. So I decided to buy Micromax phone again. Phone looks good. It is comfortable to hold even though screen size is big compared to my earlier phone (5 inch). Both the camera pictures are good and battery is easily crossing a day. So far so good.	4
good	5
The performance of this phone is not at all good as advertised by Micromax and battery gets discharged fast and is pathetic. Redmi phones are far better than Micromax.Not a good product to buy. Spending Rs. 9999 for this is not worth. Wasted my money.	3
This is the worst product i ever bought from amazon....nothing is good with this product..if any one tells me to rate its features then ill rate it as belowlooks  1/5performance  1/5battery  1/5camera  2/5although rate is less but still i suggest you all do not go for this product...	1
Amazing phone for very cheap price. Works awesome and I had no problem with this phone(writing this review for Canvas Infinity itself)	5
I feel so sad brought this because So many Failure... hanging...Auto re-start.......Tuch Not working Properly...Pl take Return and Provide another Good One	1
Worst phone.Worst touch screen.Don't buy.You'll regert.	1
Worth for this price tag.phone doesn't get heats up at all.Gave me 21hrs of battery backup with heavy usage.Camera quality is above average.	5
Working great and having nice features. Very good phone for moderate users. I was little skeptical to buy this phone after seeing the mixed reviews. But I am satisfied now after seeing it's features and performance. Got this phone at 7650 rupees on offer. Good deal for a full vision display phone...	5
The unit I received first had non-functional Finger Print reader. Don't know how it passed the Quality checks. Nevertheless, the replacement unit works great. Thought the low display resolution might be a hindrance but the display looks good. Camera quality and battery could have been better. Good for light to normal use.	4
Overall is good mobile at this price range.display and camera are awesomeBut it doesn't have gyroscope features you can not use VR HEADSET OR Google Street view app	4
I am giving my views after 3 weeks of use.1. I bought it because it was Indian.2. The battery lasts for more 24 hrs with Medium use. Whatsapp, FB, Twitter and calls and videos. It could have been better.3. The phone does not heat up.4. Audio quality is good. So is the camera. Nothing exceptional5. Value for money	4
Micromax has done a great job in providing a mobile with such good features for just 10000. Even though battery  life is decent but it's covered by features like bezel less screen, multiple window mode, portrait mode.Camera quality is good. The cost is really big advantage compared to other bezel less smartphone like lG q6.	4
I have apple 6 plus. Wht i found better den apple is finger sensor which is faster den apple and amazed. I would say the best phone in Just 10K.	5
Good device and all features what we want. I give 4 star because I don't like back, It is hard to open. Otherwise it is good mobile and it is better than oppo phone.But I don't like Mande In China things...	4
Good quality, great battery backup which I was thinking will be bad but thank God it is great. Display is awesome , Great phone in small budget	5
Seems only a boast of 3GB Ram and the processor. The phone hangs and is sluggish in performance. even hangs during the calls.	2
Good smartphoneIndian company did a very good workJust go for itI m using it since TuesdayGood things.....CameraRam 3 GBRoom 32 GB 26 GB usablePrice 9999User-friendlyVery good product in this price rangeBad thing....Charge very slowlyOverall the best phone in this price rangeAnd most important thing....This is from Indian brand....Be Indian buy Indian.....	4
One of the best in its class and a bit upset for hardcore gaming. Battery is good enough for 24 hrs.display and camera are excellent.	4
The camera quality is more than impressive and the latest version of Android, deliveres sweet performance.	5
Battery is not working 8 hours.. Files r not open properly mobile is hanging again an again an an main 5hing riten option is not showing when I purchase that time showing 15 day but now not showing what to do I have to riten this mobile I want money back	1
Amazing..... nothing can't say buy this phone and see everything.....	4
Awesome mobile , in rs 10000 ,a great bundles,if you think battery is low,but i can guarantee it will long lasting after rough use....main benefit no heating issue..during online multiplayer games or play while charging..	5
I was too much excited when I purchased it but after using 15 day I I'm disappointed coz  heating problem r there n hanging also ..some tym touch also not working... I did blender I reorder it for my mom ....not met as I expected..	3
Best phone in this price thanks micromax but it's screen gard is not so good it's color is just looks like yellow so it's better you order a screen gard	5
This device was no doubt had best specifications with low price but after using it for two months I am dissatisfied with it. Camera is not at all good. Lenovo/LG provide better camera.The software is not tested thoroughly it automatically scrolls up/down while searching for photo or contact and many more it not at all upto the mark.	2
Today I got my phone one side sealed sticker was already opened and I don't know if it's predownloaded apps but there is already apps like fb, asphalt, modijis app which normally v have to download later	3
Good phone for the price ,camera is very good,not good for hardcore gaming display isn't very bright or full HD ..should have been full HD 1080 resolution since it's 18:9 ratio. Works perfectly smooth, been using for 6 days tho.batterys is also good stays good over a day.Overall great phone very stylish.	4
Very very poor product and services by Amazon. After getting this mobile from Amazon I phase some technical issue that when mobile is restart, the mobile network not detect automatically in first time and for getting mobile network we have to restart is several time.Also phase a problem in last two days (from 23/12/2017) when any call comes in my cell the display automatically getting dark and nothing display as well as I am unable to pick call. For this I go on factory reset option but problems still happens.	1
Suitable for mild users. It has quad core processor+high quality plastic body=no heating problem.Low-lights images for both cameras are a bit disappointing, while in day light images are more acceptable. The front camera is awesome compared to other phones at similar price range.Battery does a great job, which is removable lithium polymer battery. Standby for almost 2 days, but no fast charging.	4
Really good,use super pixel mode to capture great photo.	5
Got it delivered on Wednesday. As soon as I started using it, it got hanged. From then it is working fine. Overall a good phone at this price range. After first day hang now it's working fine. User interface is good. Nice phone.  Finger print censor is weak.	4
Excellent phone in the price range 10000 ,I like everything like smooth ness, screen ,camera, etc everything is good in this range .	5
Excellent phoneExcellent service by Amazon. Ordered on 08/10/17 and received next day with out any extra charge. Using the phone since then. Excellent phone, excellent battery life, excellent sound quality. Only FM doesn't have RDS.Overall the phone is excellent.	5
Mind blowing set... Full touch display... I really like it	5
Don't buy this phone. Two major issues that I face :If you move from wifi data to sim data (VoLTE) you wont be able to make voice calls. In that case you have to either restart your phone or reactivate your sim. I face this issue on a daily basis. Horrible experience.Many a times touch screen just stops working.	1
This is the worst phone.I had bought this phone using no cost emi. Firstly i had replace due to technical issues. Second time I had got refund due to the same issue.  For this issues i have paid 1 month interest.	1
It's good phone in all features but some times hang and not displayed task bar and upper text of the phone... And after few minutes it shows automatically...	3
Phone is awesome, camera quality is excellent, easy to use and smooth touch. If u are not a hardcore game lover u must purchase this phone. I love it and no one gave this screen resolution in this price.	5
very good looking phone....i m normal game user so there is no any issue about laging.....and battery backup is quiet good according to their power.....camera quality is quiet good....so u can buy it.....	5

Thankyou Amazon for best Exchange Offer on my old mobile. This is my 3rd Micromax mobile from Amazon. Infinity is more than what i expected. Best Value for money. For those who use social networking, Photography, basic gaming this is for u guys. Don't expect high performance from under 10K budget.	5
Been using this phone for 3weeks, Display is good, once fully charged we can use it for more than a day,camera is simply awesome,looks quite premium as well ,it doesn't get hanged,after yureka black this one more killer from Micromax, kudos for that,will definitely recommend others to go for it	5
It is lagging after some time of use....battery is bad	3
I have been using this phone since first sale got released...i am satisfied with nice screen quality despite having hd resolution.. process should be 435 to work smoothly sometimes it feels little laggy. camera quality is avarage and build quality is good and feels premium...	4
Cute display very slim and weightless camera is excellent audio perfect good product from micromax 	5
Very very nice product in this price range. Super Selfi camera with good quality rare camera. Battery is quite good, with nice display and others features. I'm loving an Indian must go with it..	5
I purchased this mobile on 6th oct. and got delivere on 9th oct. Every thing in phone is great but after using the phone for one day i got issue in display. Whenever i use to call any number the phone screen got black and after call disconnect again it is fine. When i put complain a technician visited and created a folder Developer in setting and asked not to turn on this. Now the phone is working well.	4
I don't like this phone how can I return it give me feedback please I want to buy other phone it's performance isso bad	1
After one week experience -Pros--> design, edge to edge {18:9} display,  front camera is decent,  resemblence to samsung s8 from from front side so feels premium , ram management is also very goodCons--> processor which is most imp.  In a phone is comparativly on slower side. snpdrgn 425 is a outdated choice , 435 will be better one-> back camera and bokeh effect is nt up to mark	3
Sound is low.....But we can listen to it	4
What a features....it just amazing phone...I like the full vision display...2.5 D gorilla glass smooth touch ....charger of mobile is making such that while using supply never cut...and headset also good quality..... overall this Mobile is the year of the Mobile....thank you so much Micromax ...for giving us such a valuable Mobile......And as Micromax is a Indian company. ... that's the reason I brought this Mobile....Proud to be INDIAN	5

1) Display pixel and color looks pretty2) Performance is very good3) Mobile is slim and having good grip4) Front camera is more accurate5) Latest Android features	5
I have been using this phone for the last 10 days and it will assuage all ur needs nothing is to be worried about only battery is average and it will lags sometime after giving it simultaneous tasks.	4
Ok kind of product.... Front camera is good but rear camera is normal... Not so impressive... Using it from 4 days...feel heating on back... No other color is available.  Screen size is 5.7 but looks small in comparison to 5.5 size.	3
I was looking for a good Indian company smartphone since a long time. Micromax canvas infinity have fulfilled this. Though I cannot give 5 stars for the phone. But it deserves a 4 star and we should appreciate the efforts. Even though the phone currently is manufactured in China, sooner or later I hope we will match with the quality of Chinese manufacturer and start making quality phones.	4
Hi all,Recently, my phone has been having a problem with the proximity sensor during calls. When I finish a call, or want to look at my screen, the screen does not turn on by itself so I need to press the home button for the screen to light up. This is very annoying! I even turned off the option "Turn screen off during calls" (which is supposed to leave my screen lit up all the time) and the screen still goes black.Any suggestions would be very appreciated!NOTE: I am not using any case.	1
Excellent phone excellent price. Pro good camera, touch, speakers, loud speaker, full day battery,.	5
Best phone,Excellent Display,camera is also good .Worth Buy..	5
Very bad experience. Phone getting heated up and hanged up on regular basis. Will not suggest anyone to buy it	1
I loved it. Speacially the front selfie camera,and the multi tab function. Best "Smart Phone" true worth for money. Very good features and design under 10k segment..	5
Good mobile front camera gud and both camera s are gud. But internal storege given only 22 gb. Battery backup 6 hours on internet and otherwise phone is beautiful	4
I would have given 5 stars If I wasn't facing this issue. Nothing is in there 'themes'. That is empty showing 'List is empty'. And the UI of notification panel is quite laggy... Although the phone is a charmer in itself! With superb look and UI. Similar to Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. With good battery backup I would say and no heating issue... I guess it's worth it! Blockbuster in budget!	4
No good phone ....Bekar he	1
Worst smart phone by this company... As always... So many lags. Errors ... Already faced display problem within 2 months . Please don't buy.. waste of money.. and the main thing micromax said was that this phone will get latest Android updates very soon... Its been a year.. i haven't received any major update.	1
Insufficient User guide is supplied,which does contain necessary information for a layman and which is not very useful. How am I to get directions for my doubts? Otherwise the mobile seems to be OK.	4
Recived on 11/11/17 !bugs In some apps!!hangs atleast one time a day n have to remove battery n restart it!!seems like micromax sacrificed performance for looks!also  fast draining of battery when compared to others!touch sensitivity low!thinking of giving ph to service centre!	1
Great phone at gud price....	5
I am in love with Micromax. Infinity is really good. and I am happy using this.	5
Well a nice phone for Casual use but.this phone is not good Enough for gaming not as Games lag on This phone but Battery is Lil Bit Low gaming.Else Good camera, attractive Look And Smoth . if you r buying It For Non gamers Than u Should go for it .	4
Ordered this mobile 4 days back. Amazon delivery is prompt & at the right time.Regarding Mobile, after 4 days usage I have observed these:- Battery Backup is the major problem. Battery is draining like anything once u browse through mobile.- 5.7" screen doesn't look like so.Apart from above two points... Mobile is worth buying!!!	4
very bad mobile , charging was not continuously stand bycgarging capacity is very badnow my phone is switched off , what i will do, my phone doesn't taken charging	1
Value for money. Under 10k it is a good phone good camera quality good design sorry very good design. One missing. It is not a full HD display overall good mobile.	4
Go For It.Be unique and Be Forward.EveryOne is Looking for a Good phone. It is Somehow a Good phone for sure.Don't Judge it by it's Name. It's really a Good Product from Micromax.Jai Mahismati. Jai Micromax.	5
Awesome Indian made mobile at this price. Super battery backup, quick charging of 30-40% in 15 min, no heating problem like earlier mobiles, unbelievable selfies with 16 MP cam... worth buying at this lowest cast.. I just loved it. Thank you Micromax.	5
Absolute value for money. This phone can be compared to the looks and feel of a premium phone. Good features and commendable battery life. Keep it up Micromax	5
One of wrost phone in my purchase life nothing good with this hanging,heating,battary everything wrost now I came why Micromax lost his place	2
Very bad for use. Hanging problem. Networking problem, internet connectivity problems.	1
Phone has lag of few seconds, battery should've been a bit more. Rest is okay with the phone. Thought Micromax is amnufactured in India and bought the phone. It is made in China.	3
Very Good Product Nice Mobile Micromax Canvas Infinity Thanks Amazon..!	5
Worst product. Within two days started auto shutdown and dead mode only the red led indicator at top right side. Referred to care centre but no use, finally sold with scrap value.	1
Phone not working properly.  It's nott been even 1 month their is mang problems in the phone. Worst product . Amazon please refund amd take your product.	1
Lot of hang issue, inbuilt email not found, inbuilt browser not found, inbuilt document viewer not found, lot of videos not support and more huge problem.	1
Micromax did good job here,a little OS optimisation is required, hope we will get it soon in next updates. No matches in this price range.Thank you amazon for excellent service as always.	5
Awesome phone at this price range, I bought it on 1st of spetember and after around 1 month of use I can definitely say that this phone is great.Gr8 lookz, Camera is superb, Battery is ok ok, and I didn't felt any laggs or issue.	5
Nice product	5
Phone was awesome. I bought it in its first sale. If you ignore below points:1. Data is used even when Data is turned off. This might have been resolved from their software update.2. Screen brightness is low and screen visibility is low under sunlight.3. High end games do lag and is noticeable.	4
Phone is very good looking...Nice nice...Performance is also good...buT the fingerprint sensor not works sometimes....All over is good....Headphone are not good get damaged in 1 week only pls help regarding it amazon....	4
Budget smartphone for mediocre users!!	5
Worst product. Trying to use it for six months. Absolutely wastage of money. No performance, no service centre. Please don't go for any micromax product.	1
Superbbbb phone really  Micromax good work	5
I got my phone and what I thought how it would be was it was more good than that. The full display is even more interesting and the features are amazing!	5
After used 6 month .this phone got hung and laoding sim contact every time .poor phone	1
This fone is very sleek and classy. It is very professional, with all the basic important feature in it. I love the way they pack, and deliver the product with quick delivery. The fone has most of the best features for a desirable fone, but I only noticed a few things in the quality of sound and video, which is less. Other than that.. it's worth buying.	4
Amazing experience at low cost....! Worth buying it....!	5
Very good display. Super battery backup. Fast performance	5
Within 2 days it is giving problemRear camera is not good as compair to 13 mpIts hang too muchFingerprint not work it accept anyonce finger and phone gets unlockFully disappointed by this phoneRecommended not to buy it smart phone	1
Very poor.Just 3 months since I purchased it and battery weak and not working	1
WhatsApp connectivity problem is there need to restart mobile every time it gets disconnected tried all possibilities unable to resolve this, unwanted notification are popping up and unable to disable them, mobile gets hanged some times, camera is good	2
No gyroscope, cannot use vr headsetContacts photo are blurry whenever we call and whenever we receive calls, bad product, do not buy it	1
Camera quality is zero.....its only showing big MP else its same as 3 MP	1
Mobile look is good and camera image quality bis poor and it's discharging pretty quickly and even the user interface is made to look better on ad and not to the level of MI BRAND ALSO can't believe where Micromax is headed from here	2
Good product, only charger is not proper and it is not charging phone. I have to use my old charger. I was expecting product which has screen size bigger in width but it is bigger in height. But no problem with performance so far.	4
Exacalant phone for 9999, battery, sound,camera,screen,touch and every thing is super. Awesome...... Super product I really thank to Micromax to introduce this kind of phone.	5
Product dosen't work as of now. I want to return this product. It is hardly 15 days since I purchased this product.	1
Delivery by Amazon was fast and on the clock. But the product is bad. First, it's completely a Chinese phone, nothing Indian. Both cameras are pathetic.  Slow processor.  I am shocked how Micromax can come into the market with such a pathetic phone. Go for Nokia-3.Rakesh	1
Micromax canvas infinity is good phone.camara good picture clarity both cameras. No heating and battery good.sound is very good clarity.	5
I ordered a canvas Infinity. Amazon delivered a defective piece. The phone only worked when it was connected to a charger. Didn't know I'd get a landline when I specifically ordered a cellphone. I filed a replacement request. Guess what. Amazon delivered another defective piece with the SAME ISSUE! What chicanery is this! I'd give minus 5 stars if I could!	1
Best ever phone from the house of Micromax. Specially its Portrait mode features while taking photos is a unique feature. Only iPhone X have this feature which cost 1 lac and Micromax have provided these features only within 10K	5
I have satisfaction with this phone but some times its lag and when I click on bottom, it opens otherside apps. when i play some games on it sometime lags and heats up fast. You can see the unboxing video of Micromax canvas infinity on my YouTube channel Manik Arora tech videos. 3 stars for delivery and for processor. BATTERY life is good as compared as others	3
One of the best mobile in that price range....good camera ...and also Snapdragon 425 ....	4
Phone look is grant	5
It's been three days now that I have used the phone. I have to say Micromax really did a good job this time by providing a high quality phone with premium looking features & better camera &  battery back up. I have used four Micromax phones till date starting from Aisha to Canvas 6 excluding this one and battery & camera features were always unsatisfactory in those compared to other similar priced smartphones.This has an excellent camera but I would prefer the 16 Megapixel camera be provided at back rather than front because I am not much of a selfie person. Battery capacity is enough to last a complete day with average usage like whatsapping, surfing & the phone does not have much of a heating issue.Call quality has also improved from previous Micromax phones and VOLTE calls are clear & sharp.Only thing I feel a little unsatisfied about is the display. After using Canvas 6 which had a DPI of 403, this one feels a little paler compared to Canvas 6 as it's DPI is around 318.But considering the price of  10000 & host of other features that is being provided, this flaw can be ignored. Those upgrading from lower end budget phones, the lower DPI will not be a flaw at all.I have provided one low light shot taken using the Super Pixel feature in rear camera to give an idea of the camera quality.	4
this device is not so much good as I expected. there has many problem with this mobile. it is becoming too hot when I charge it. the videos cannot be save on youtube. everytime it needs to redownload. I am not satisfied. I want to change this device as I bought this with exchange offer . but I cant. the return window has closed everytime.	1
Volume drop down and mute automatically while using headphones	1
Camera quality is good serious hanging problem is there. Figer sensor also does work well. I replaced it with MI phone and that was not the right desiscion. An indian company will become out of the market if they are unable to compete	3
Awesome phone with great features,Thanks Micromax	5
It's great phone, performance and new features worth of money bt there is prblm that this phone is made in china. The owner of micromax should make this phone in our country INDIA and thnx to  Amazon for fast delivery	4
This is not a good phone because battery backup is not good and music player sounds is very bed loo and year phone is also bad sound just like a local Street product sound..... I'm Totally waste of money for this product...	1
Very bad product, don't waste money in buying this. When I try to dial a number it is not responding. Worst camera, poor processor.Waste waste waste!!!only good thing in the phone is front camera.	1
If compare to price this Phone is good. But some time notification are come that time mobile suddenly hang.	4

Super Phone and value for price, I am amazed by Micromax Infinity and planning to get another one in next sale.	5
Good displayBattery goodCamera perform well in daylightPoor night vision cameraHangs sometimes	5
What a phone nice cool mobile and camera quality is very nice and its display very nice buy this product nice products...	5
just awesome phone at this price range only small problem is that the snapdragon 425 is little slow but ot can be neglected taking in view the other facilities given at this price range.......	5
Very very poor camera and product quality wise dear all please do not purchase this mobile.... Very bad product amozone tell me this product is very excellent product............ But this is fake product	1
Great phone in budget love to shape weight etc. Phone speaker is very bad sound is not clear to hear specially when i play vedio. Touch is gud but not very gud littil slow, clarity is gud. Over all this is a budget phn to buy. Gadget lover don't Buy this they have disopinted.	3
Aisa dhasu or super camera phone Aj tak apne life me pahle kv nahi dekha .super camera and display was oowesome	5
Phone is worth on this price	5
NOT AS EXPECTED MICROMAX IS POOR	3
I used in 45 days in this mobile.very good for normal uses.both cameras good for this price range mobiles.no heating issues.ok for battery.not recommended gaming and heavy users.better than China mobiles.only con is no updates.	4
I like the product design, UI,Performance. Everything is good. It would be great if battery capacity is more	5
Performance is very poor. If Micromax wants to serviwe in market. You have give good quality product.	1
Really worth the money. Its the perfect choice where customer enjoys latest features without investing in costly brands. Inside box, everything was intact as described in listing.	5
Nice mobile, no problem still and responses fast. Finger print sensor works awesome.	5
It was a complete disaster to buy Micromax infinity, the phone gets hanged every moment and very slow, the touch screen is very bad and over all performance is a complete disaster	1
All is Good but something slow phone .	4
Doesn't feel like 3GB Ram. The touch is not good at all. The finger print unlock sometimes doesn't work. The phone gets hanged and you have to restart it.	2
It is a excellent phone in 9999 light weight and good thing is that u get protective case and screen guard absolutely free and experience with amazon is excellent and mind blowing	5
This product is an average phone ! Please only buy if you seriously want a phone ! Becuase the camera is awful and display is so bright that you cant even identify the color	2
Pros. Very good look, dedicated memory card slot, 18:9 aspect ratio display, light weight, removable battery and promise to upgrade latest Android security patch and Android oreo.Cons. Battery capacity less than 3000 mah, no quick charge support.	4
Very nice mobile.. infinity display supab... excellent build quality.. fine camera...2900 mah battery but good charge service... Overall best in 9999 rs... I very very like it...	5
Found it better when compared to other Micromax phones. Not sure how it is good when compared to other brands because I haven't used them. Quality of this phone is really good.	5
Used it for almost 10-12 days, pretty fast and light in hand. No lagging, low signal or battery drainage as seen in some rating seen (not a heavy user). A great phone inside 10k budget 	5
LOTS OF TIME WHATS UP IS NOT STARTING THEN I HAVE TO REBOOT THE PHONE. EVEN TOUCH IS ALSO NOT GOOD. BATTERY POWER IS REALLY GOOD. BUT NO OTHER INBUIT APPLICATION ARE THR	1
Just got it yesterday..just one day old but I am satisfied as per the camera quality or Facebook live video is very clear and sounds music quality also good..YouTube sound could have been louder but that doesn't matter and other staffs like battery and all is also good..I am satisfied till now...display size or color contrast is also impressive..everything is good...like for this..	4
Awsm smartphone	5
Maybe my expectation was little high with this device. They are having good product in this price range. Camera is good, but not the best in this price range	4
Good Smartphone at this price and I hope Micromax will give Android Oreo update in future	5
Camera is bad quality  not like 13 mp and 16 mp just like 5 mp rear camera and 8 mp front camera but process is good and designed is perfect no doubt but camera is very bad	3
In this price range,no other brand got such an excellent camera(both),specially selfie camera.....But processor is slow compare to redmi and other competitive brand.....Display is killer......Not made for hardcore gamers.....Battery performance is average.....	4
Nice mobile handle softly pictures quality is nice	5
Had touch screen issues twice. Got to remove the battery completely to make it work again.Rear camera is not worthy for 10k.Display and feel is good	3
Good mobile with good h/w in MicromaxBut some times it's working slowly	4
The Bokeh effect on rear camera is somewhat poor if compared with MI A1.Front is OK.Otherwise Camera Quality is satisfactory.A good phone in this budget.If you want a decent camera quality phone,go for it.	4
Worst camera quality ,camera is not worth even rs 2000.i just want to return this phone but amazon provides no return policy ,i really hate it.its a big fraud to get money from the customers n then making them helpless later on by providing no return policy	1
Best phone in this budget	5
everythng is good for this phone..except its finger print sensor..it does nt work properly	4
Amazing mobile. Not any bad comments. Just one problem I feel this mobile it's a hang in only one day usage. I am not installed any app recently in this mobile.	3
I have purchased before 2 day ago, but I feel this is good phone ram and rom is good, but minor issue may be occurred i.e. Battery. It seems that the battery backup not so much, phone discharge rapidly. Rest good.	4
At this price range this phone is very good with most of the features available in any other high end phones.battery back up is good.phone doesn't get heated up quickly.overall feedback about this phone would be "very good'	4
I bought this mobile on first sell. In this product a minor issue is that if you install another launcher for personalised your phone your mobile should be hang	4
I brought  this mob  last month  but now suddenly dead without any  damage  I really dissatisfied with this  brand ....	1
product add and original prudact is like day and night differences and brightness is very low. all time need to full.and i have another charging problm with my phone..	1
Phone is awesome... You can buy it without any doubt... But battery is draining fast just one negative point...	5
It is a very good phone compared to price of the phone. It also has blur effect on background while capturing photos just like DSLR camera.	5
Phone is very nice... Nice features as they have said!Very good Camera quality.	5
Good product guys u like this phone,touching quality is so smooth and fingerprint scanner is also work smoothly, guys you never face hitting and hanging problem in this phone so I I like this phone in Rupees 10000 only lovely phone by Micromax .	5
Sorry to inform I am using Micromax Canvas infinity mobile from past 3 months Selfi camera is not working ...I don't know what is the issue this problem occured after Micromax version update.	2
This was my 3 mobile of micromax brand in last 5 years it was a very Good product at this price better than many Chinese brands like opo vivio goine etc who are selling not on quality but on forced advertising.Be Indian buy Indian	4
Screen locks repeatedly and restore only when battery is removed.Wrote to micromax but no response.Purchase on own risk	1
Awesome  phone with low budget..  people must go 4 it rather than vivo ir oppo.Cz itz provides a good selfie camera plus infinity display..	5
It's a worst product...don't buy it..very bad experience with this phone .. no accessory available in market till now.. i suffer after buy this phone	1
Medium quality	3
Micromax canvas infinity is better phone,front camera,back camera,and battery life is superb I LOVE IT	5
it is having mother board problem with in package itself ...i am looking to return it to the amazon but i didnt seen return option	1
Data cable of the handset is defective and not working. Hence kindly replace it.	1
Camera and display quality is too good, but finger print sensor doesn't work or about 10% success unlocked condition	3
Just awesome, Just Buy it you will get everything in 10K Mobile. Thanks Micromax and Amazon for this product.Cloudtail, you are doing well pls go ahead!!	5
Phone is good but earphone not working properly right side speaker volume is to low and if i touch earphone jack thn left speaker also not working	3
Nice phone. Nice display pretty fast worth the price I have seen many negative comments about the speaker volume that is wrong the speaker display is worth the pricr a must buy phone with 10k.range thanks Micromax	5
Phone book isn't working properly one contact get saved 3 times automatically	3
Look wise the mobile is Good but voice quality is very bad. Its just 2 months since i purchased. It doesn't work good in loudspeaker. Its microphone is damaged.	1
Rating this phone's features out of 5....after using this phone for last one month.....1.looks -because of full vision display----- 5points2.battery-2900 mAh battery-------4.5points3.sound-quite loud and clear----4.5 points4.camera-16mp front camera----5 points5.screen-5.77 cm--4.5 point..6.gaming----not good for gaming----3 points7.heating problem---little ;----3points	5
Pros:Very nice UI. Easy to use.Fast response UI.Bezel less view is awesome especially when you watch a photo or video in 18:9 full screen.Both Camera are good. Day photography with 18:9 resolution is just cream.Timelapse really works well. I have tested 5x and 10x. Have to get some time to test 300x.Selfie is awesome. It's wide angle selfie, you  should select a good background to get a nice view selfie.Panorama is quite wide angle and covers a very good height comparable to my Moto G3. Looks very nice, does not look like photo joined unlike other phones.Phone does not heat much. No heating while internet download even on a moving vehicle.Display of the phone is bit reddish which makes videos/movie very attractive. You will enjoy.. although the resolution is 720p, but the quality is good. Pictures look sharp when you watch a movie. I have compared with Moto G3, OnePlus 5 and Yunicorn.Day to day operation is quite smooth and lag free.Using the Finger Print sensor is a charm. It instantly unlocks the screen.Battery will easily last 2 days with normal use. For me it lasts 1.5 days with moderate use of internet. Even with heavy usage you can carry throughout the day.Con: 1080p display was better for the competition, but again it needed more battery.Camera quality in low light is not impressive. But in this range I did not find better than this. Tested Xiaomi Note 4, Yunicorn and Moto G3.Build Quality could have been better. I wanted strong edges like Moto G3.Corning Gorilla glass is missing. Although it has become common in new phones still I want Gorilla glass protection.	5
This is a best phone in 9999 camera is superb it is loking a primum phone in your hand infnty display add a swag in this phone thanku micromax	5
exellent performance for this price ragegood displayexellent camera bothblindly go for it manits worth for mny	5
Nice product by Micromax. No need to think twice before buying.	5
good phone but hanging problem,some times touch not working,finally good for money,competitor for mi phones	4
Hanging Problem. Whatsup wont working properly. Camera is good. Battery could have been better. Cont even exchange with other mobile if u dont want this mobile. you wont get replacement. worst service by Amazon.	3
Poor camera quality, if we give WiFi hotspot in few minutes it gets heat. On call if we put on loud speaker the another person will not able to hear our voice. This phone is not even listed for the exchange on Amazon if we want to buy another phone for exchange..	1
The phone is great for it's price,The only concern that I've observed in it was that it's UI is laggy but a launcher can solve that problem.And since I've been using it for about a couple of months it is a nice phone.	3
Very bad experience with this mobile .. Very poor performance..Camera not even working properly.. Got mobile on 11th sep 2017 within 25 days my mobile experience is worse than anything.. Pls dont watse your money.	1
The battery performance is awsome, but small issue with mylauncher	4
Im not satisfied with this model.. often the phone is getting hanged and touch is not working properly. Everytime, i either have to switch it off or reboot the mobile. Really Iim getting irritated with this phone. Please don't sell it via these websites..	2
Definately go to go phone within budget... purchased 10days ago	5
Ok satisfied achha phone h but fingers print scanner is not fast working and some time hanging. Is Price range me achha h	4
In this price segment no one other to compete.Both camera good	5
Fantastic Phone from Micromax, if you want Stylish phone under 10k, go with Canvas Infinity.Review after using 15 days.	5
Excellent phoneBought this phone to show my patriotism.	5
Camera is fine, lite weight and looks wise is also good.The back side panel look poor, as its made of plastic.Rest its good phone	4
Using since 7 days no problems , no lags , and yes the camera is way excellent in this price range , 3 gb ram enables a good multitasking, in just 10000 this is a complete package. Go for it 	5
It's Hanging from the very first hour ..But Everything is good except it ..Specially The front camera 	3
Pros: no heating issueCons: Battery backup not good	3
Pros :. + good battery back up + sleek and slim + non hybrid sim slotCons: -- average display -- sluggish performance	3
Value for money. Everything fine except the launcher crashes sometimes. Camera quality ok. Front camera performs better than rear one.	3
Rest is good it's just phone is getting banged at least 2-3times a day. Need to reboot every time	4
unboxing & reviews - Best budget smartphone under 10k	4
It looks a premium phone.Awesome design, Bright and bigger screen , Good touch . Good camera specially selfie , camera features are also good.Multitasking is good, I did not checked for games which required very high performance.For me it is an excellent mobile.	5
Low sound volume , back camera quality low, no cam scanner	1
Good for medium cost phone. Quite slow in operation, photos are dull in night time, taking more time for full charging..	4
It's OK. Restart is required once in 2 to 3 days.	4
It's a great product by Micromax!!! Nicely designed, display is very pretty and smooth.. processor is great.. overall it's a 'Dhamakedaar' mobile phone in this price range!!!	5

Honest review...I was mi note 3 user.  So I am writing on that mobile compare basis....1. Even mmx have snapdragon.. It's slow that mi. Slow opening of app, slow transition etc.2. Battery  2900 mah works preety good.3. Screen is good, but clarity is less than mi.4. Image shown on box of mmx is fake. Mobile is of different look.5. Front camera is 100% more good than mi note 3.6.back camera is also better than mi.7. Sound quality is little low than mi note 3. It's ok ok.8. Overall mmx have done a good job.9. Ui is also ok but still need little work.10. It's not as user friendly as mi.11. U can buy it.. 10 k is ok priced.12. Both have there own feature.13. Ignoring screen clarity, everything seems good in mmx. Satyam suresh singh 9118444999	3

This phone could have been better if it had 16:9 aspect ratio as well. Rear camera doesn't seem to be 13mp even when kept in 13M. It's more like 8M. And Micromax should have given a full HD display. Also, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos would have made it sound much better.I am updating my review. This phone keeps rebooting. There was an update of software recently from Micromax. But the problem is still there. The loudspeaker is of very poor quality. The rear camera does not perform like a 13 megapixel. It is more like a 5 megapixel. The front camera is 16 megapixel but what is the use? The charger that came with the phone is a slow charger.  It takes ages to charge the phone. Much better phones are available in the market in this price range.	1

Worst product I yet seen...	1
I have been using this phone for last couple of days and found it to be good enough for an average user.Full vision dsiplay is the main highlight.You will find it great while playing videos and games.Performance wise, it has given me an amazing experience as it has never lagged or hung.Handling wise its premium. Looks wise it is amazing.For 10k, its a great buy. I dropped the idea of buying Nokia 6 after looking at it.You can see the number of Applications I have installed and its performing well.Think and save your hard earned money.	5

Guys after using 1 month here is the review ,Good battery, full view screen, great selfi camera, good primary camera, 32 gb,3 gb ram , no heating issue, good model, no weightAll are for 10,000 only,  so good in budget.Moreover proudly say this is made in India, of course some parts imported from China as online reviews says. But anyway one company hardly trying to compte with rest of this world & they almost there. Hope all the best to Micromax team , hope they would compete apple. With in 10,000 they can provide us like this best phone, if we would give chance just imagine for 80,000 they can make it miracles.So guys I request you first brand your India business I mean first respect & value , believe our products, I am dam sure that days are not more far away one day world buy & prefer our products. And all that can be happen with your support guys. So please brand and proudly say this is our product.By the way this is third product from Micromax which I bought. I am not fan of Micromax but believe me I prefer because those products which  I bought & used from Micromax all are still in good condition & didn't get any trouble apart from very very small issues but at the same which I used & bought from other brand products, faced heating issues , hanging issues, battery down issues. This is true, I respect geninue why should I take that product which is not good. Just think.	5

Fine display and battery backup . Camera not good quality	4
Best thing is it's awesome screen to body ratio is excellent very much better than LG Q6, for those who want better rear camera can select super pixel option in camera settings it gives very good zooming details, battery backup for 2900mah is quite decent. Only the back look is not good it could have been like other not like XIOMI.Very light weightCONS720P display...After update the system update button in the strings stopped working.	5
Pros:- 1- Best camera 2-ifinity display3-metal designCons:- 1-average battery2-720p display not full hd3-no fast chargerOverall best phone value of moneyIn 10k	4
Though MICROMAX IS A INDIAN company but it's  @@@NOT MADE IN INDIA@@@....WHEN I RECEIVED MY PHONE ON THE BOX IT IS MENTIONED AS @@@@MADE IN CHINA@@@ which is ridiculous. If I would have known that I'm getting a made in CHINA phone then I would have opted for CHINESE company phones only... after seeing this label MADE IN CHINA.I even went to sell this phone  but no one was ready to buy it  coz redmi is available for them at 7K only.I expected  this mobile to be MADE IN INDIA & not made in elsewhere.1.Sometimes phone is acting weird(hanging) unable to operate anything need to restart phone in order to use the phone, now a days it's becoming a regular task.2. Unable to pickup incoming calls also at times, even today I have faced this problem.3. All of a sudden some apps stop working.Hope these comments would have some impact on the maker of the phone.	1
Hello everyone,This phone looks awesome.Better features than LG Q6,which are missing in Q6 like notification light,cast screen,big display,bundled accessories back cover can be opened.Yes its it's display is low but manageable.Regarding front camera in indoors pics looks yellowish,but outdoor is great.Back camera is okay.Suddenly notifications are coming like playing tone, balance low.It needs to be rectified in next update.Battey is okay.Only Gyroscope is missing.Double tap to switch off display is not working.Games are playing okay.Its processor is low but manageable for moderate users.All in all it's good phone according to it's price range.	4
Awesome front camera ...Great back camera at low light and advance feature in one step ...Display quality is great in price under 10 kBattery given 2900 mah...but it look like 4000 mah thankx to Micromax..Mobile has premium feel which no one will give in segment...No  lagging at any stage ...Infinity is really infinity ...feel proud on Micromax ..Hope that also launch more infinity with advance 18:9 ratio...Verdict .... Without thinking go for it...Prem	5
value for money	5
Great phone from Micromax, Hearlty congrats to everyone who trusted and brought the phone.Likes:1. Display as promised very fine finished.2. Speaker volume is good and best .3. No heating issue over calls or while charging.4. Even though there is no quick/fast charging the time take to fully charge is around 2 hours and considerably good. 1.5 days of battery availability with silent battery saver.5. UI mode is a mirror copy of iphone which looks good.6. Camera is best of best ,  front cam with flash, Autofocus works exactly as in reviews over youtube.7. Phone is thin and less weight.8. No lag while using, With my previous phone redmi note 3 over multiple usage of apps there was sluggish in usage.Drawback or something which could have improved.1.quick charging2.Could have manufactured in India promoting make in India.3. Dual cam could have captured the depth of the image like in evok.	5
Working good.satisfied with the product as I expected.Headset has excellent bass and ultimate music clarity.Display quality is also good and it's quite large compared to budget mobiles in this range. Camera quality for both front and back good for  this range.It has also long battery backup. Totally performance wise good product to purchase.	4
I ordered this phone on 1st September flash saLe. I have a Samsung. Phone screen is big enough to do all multimedia stuff. Definitely not bulky. Good front camera for selfie. Should have given 16mp same camera at the back. A good phone for 10k rs. Connectivity is good.wifi works great. Don't compare to s8 or iPhoneX . In this budget you are getting a best deal. Also I was looking different colors. Which micromaX needs to think about. Also increase battery size.	3
To be honest, The phone worked fine and i liked the performance except for the UI lag.But the touch screen at some portion stopped working after 15 days of usage. No breakage of parts from my side. Low quality parts including touch screen and display, is used. When I called and asked micromax service care for a replacement, they said that they don't bknow anything and told me to contact service center. And when I visited the service center, they said it will take 1 week for replacement of parts for a brand new phone and said there will not be any replacement. One of the worst customer care I have seen. Bad phone and even worse customer care. I suggest u to go for some other phones at this price range. Or buy it at your own risk.	1
hello,recently i have ordered micromax canvas infinity HS2 from Amazon and suddenly after 2-3 days this phone got hanging but we ignored but now the problem persists and its touch is not working. we want to open contacts it is opening amazon or any other appvery disappointedplease exchange this phone or make this problem solvereply fast	1
This phone has a pretty look. Front Camera quality is superp,thankfully it has front flash too. Though it doesn't support  turbo charge battery performance is good.No heating problem till now.But only bad thing is user interface it is comparatively bad and have to  improve..	4
Best phone under 10k, by..by Chinese,Me micromax ke bohut friend you..Good job micromax.....My favorite mobile company	5
A good featured phone after a long time from Micromax.Pros-1- Works properly, no hanging problem.2- finger print sensor is quite good.3- Good battery life.4- split screen feature provides two apps to run simultaneously on your screen5- sound quality & display is good.Cons-1- front camera is not up to mark.2- not suitable for hardcore gamers.3- takes around 3 hours to charge from 0-1004- overpriced5- Micromax is an Indian company but the product is made in China	3
Performance and quality isn't as good as it seems to be, phone lags too much, build quality is very cheap. Overall all I can say is this phone looks like the retarded cousin of Samsung Galaxy S8 and performs like the retarded cousin of Galaxy S8.	1
Hi,I bought Micromax Canvas Infinity and sharing this review on my personal use.Micromax Canvas Infinity comes with a price tag of Rs. 9999/- mid range with great specs and that's the very first thing that attracts consumers.3 Things I personally like about this phone:1. Design- This phone features an infinity display which itself catches all the attention, again looking at the entire design Micromax has done a great job here giving it a slick look, feels really good and light weight in hand.2. Sim/Memory- It has a dual sim and  also supports microSD card up to 128GB. So i don't have to switch between sim and microSD card. It houses 32 GB of internal storage with 3 GB RAM, not to forget it also supports OTG which gives additional storage for your media.3. Front camera- 16 MP with a front flash has a pretty decent quality and the camera app which has inbuilt beautify modes make it more appealing.3 Things which disappoints about this phone:1. Performance- Unlocking the phone is really slow. It take its own time to unlock which after using for a while gets annoying. Switching between cameras is slow; whereas i didn't have any difficulty in switching apps. So its a mid performance phone.2. Battery- This phone has a removable battery of 2900 mAh, which I find to be not enough for heavy users even if you are only using it for internet browsing.3. Display- No full HD display.Over all, Not to forget this phone comes under Rs.10000/- and comparing it with other product I find it to be pretty impressive at this price band .My experience with this phone was pretty good.Please leave comments below if this was helpful.Thanks for reading.	5
I book this mobile no 1st of September and I get it by 4th of September. In this price one of the best mobile from my point of view . Highlight is  quality it was really sooooooo good. All r telling in this budget MI is best but my point of u Infinity is best thanks to Micromax. But only 2things r little bad1st I can't able to use mobile in sunlight plzzz improve the brightness2nd u can improve battery is really importantOther then it's really good and packing also super thanks to Amazon	4
Only condition which u don't have to go for this phone is .. only if u r a heavy gamer... , if u want above average speed with large display.. it not infinity display..  Rest camera ,battery, overall new operating system, screen resolutiom, volume, accessories along with phone, handling, all in all its a great package for price.. preloaded camera software is fun to experiment with and front flash does the low light photo possible... Battery is above average know ...All my friends are dispointed coz of Micromax .. coz of its after sale service, let's hope it resovles issues quickly coz it's a popular saying .. Micromax Canvas last max for a year.  Hope Micromax improves its after sale services or built phones for lasting longer.	5
Best Smartphone in Budget .proud to indian company black colour in fabulous .but one senser missing gyroscope senser i hope Micromax next smartphone complete in All sensers but phone is okay	4
This phone is quite good with its specification. But i don't know why it got hanged so badly it is not even reboot. I can't see notification tab, even if i try to slide down it. I buy this phone because it is an indian company and i believe everyone should promote indian brands instead of china products. Back cover is very hard to remove. First you will not understand how to remove back cover which was quite funny to find. Then i saw everything inside was made by china. Somewhere i felt this and requesting micromax to start manufacture all the products in india instead of taking it from china. Now i will show this phone to service centre. Lets see how they respond it. But think before you go for this.	2
Hi, its been more then 1 week of use..its a genuine review after use of 1 week.Pros:Best camera at this costFinger print is fine (considering the fact that we are not launching atom bomb or rocket through finger print)Screen size is really big24*7 service and replacement warrantyStock androidRemoval batteryViewing angle are decent3gb ram 32 GB internalNow cons:Battery could have been 4000 mah which is decentProcessor could be octacore 625 or 630This is not a full HD deviceYou tube will support only 720 pixel videoFinally the product is for normal users camera is best with optimum battery. The phone is not ment for hardcore gamers. If you are a hard core gamer then go for redmi note 4.Thanks	5
After Using 4 month I found 2 CONS.1.SlowProcessor  onlyIf you are heavy gamer than it not for you. And2.Slow Finger print sensor.Rest of all features are very good.Both Camera and sound Superb.Premium look and big full view Screen.Budgeted Phone	4
Superb mobile in this price range . Really love it . Camera is awesome. Smart handset . Love it. Recommended to all of u guys. Micromax really done a good job with this mobile ..	5

It's a very good phone - go for it without any second thought. Camera quality is ok and have been using it from last 1month and it never hangs. Battery discharging is as per usage. There are times when the charge lasted for more then 30 hours.	5
This review may help people who gonna buy this mobile on 8th september :pPROS :-No Heating Problem - The best thing I love in this phone is there is no much heating, I had played some heavy games like Dungeon Hunter 5, Brothers in Arms 3, Future Fight, Mortal Kombat X etc., for more than a hour but I didn't feel much heat.Camera Quality - Camera quality(16mp front and 13mp rear both flash) is good at this price, I'm very much impressed with some effects like Portrait and Timelapse.Display - 5.7" screen with 720x1440 pixels resolution has both pros and cons. Eventhough it has 5.7" screen mobile smaller than many other 5.5" smartphonesOS - Latest Android Nougat 7.1.2, with some smart actions & smart gestures, "OK GOOGLE" works perfectly. :PFinger Print - Finger Print sensor is pretty fast than the most Lenovo and Moto phones.Charging - Charging Time is also good, it charges 2900mah battery within One and half an hour.SIM & SD Card Slot - It has 2 micro SIM slot and a dedicated SD Card slot (Upto 128GB)GPS - GPS compass is also accurate.CONS:-Portrait Games - This is an important cons, when I play portrait games (Ex: Clash Royale) the display seems to be cut on the width (this is due to 5.7" display). Not the problem for landscape games.Gaming Experience - I played Modern Combat 5 some part of games are bit laggy :(. Other games that I have listed in pros works cool.Battery - For Normal and Medium users battery will last for 1day. But for heavy users like me(crazy on gaming) it stands only for 6 - 8 hours so I listed in cons.Eventhough it has cons I gave 5star, because it is fair at this priceOTHERS:-Sound Quality - Sound quality is good and impressed with headphones (I don't like volume UI)Processor - It has 1.4GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 with Adreno 303 GPU (Not the powerfull but good performance with Nougat and fair at this price)Memory - 3GB RAM and 32GB ROM (Almost or Atmost 22GB Available) which is also good.Overall Micromax Canvas Infinity is best for medium users and selfie psycho'sFinal Word for Micromax - "Keep Going! You're on right track" :)	5
people it is not a phone problem its your data problem which you put inside and hangs ur phone...i am using this phone for a week now and it doesnt show any sign of problems which u have raised....and fingrprint is working 10  out of 10...sometimes they dont work due to peeling of our skin its problm with evry phone	5
I got this product before date ... Its not like infinity screen which is shown to us not like samsung S8 but at this price range it goodNot good for game loversCamera is not like much impressive both camera are just okBattery life is good but it has normal charger so mobile takes more time to chargePerformance is good not so farI give 3 stars cause camera is not on the mark	3
Good product at good price and the big thing it is a purely indian manufacturing and I proud to an Indian.great micromax.kwep it up what a camera and above all excellent product. Such a awesome product.	5
Whatapp functioning problem with this phone.... sometimes... automatically will not be able to receive or send messages ...after reboot it'll b fine ....but we can't do it always ...I hope with the next system update it'll b taken care of	3
Got it the next day of release ..does not support turbo charging but does charge upto 75% in an hour ..which is not bad at all.. Numerous features at hand ..like the immediate notification changes ..u can set then and there ..Finger print sensor can be used to open apps ..awesome camera when compared to higher end phones ..good speaker quality ..looks awesome ..all features have been provided flexibility ..Just love the phone ..And not to miss the flawless typing	5
Good phone in 10000 Rs. Initially felt like battery is small but after installing new update the battery performance improved drastically. I watch lots of YouTube videos and still able to use it for 1 and half days. Camera also very good especially front camera. Need to improve back camera and UI a bit but that's not a deal breaker at this price range. Micromax is doing fantastic stuff. Success will not come overnight please have a patience and keep doing good stuff. Service yet to experience. This phone is not for VR users and  gamers.	5
camera quality is very poor and its display see like a blur display ...But it's price very unique 9999 so its a good product.purchased it for myself,really it's worth the money .phone looks very premium.Good quality, great battery backup which I was thinking will be bad but thank God it is great. Display is awesome , Great phone in small budget	4

Awesome product from Micromax. I am fully satisfied with it's stunning looks, product quality, performance. It can beat any Chinese smartphone products in the market currently. You can blindly go for this smartphone. Also urge who are seeing my review to give off Chinese products and promote Indian products.	5
	5
Camera quality poor both rear & front.Display & color reproduction good.Movie watching experience nice for movie lover but sound output low.Touch good responsive.Finger print scanner work well.Looking may be nice if device body are in metal finish and color gold.Battery backup good.Calling quality good.LTE connectivity fine.	4
Please ensure the product IMEI no (box- mobile- invoice )Cross check the same	3
Best phone in this budget no heating no hang and no lag	5
Good Job...MicromaxBest phone under 10K..Micromax this time you deserve 100 out of 100 marks	5
Amazon .....About phone : -Camera is goodBattery is okDisplay is okSound is normalHanging problem is there ...Touch id working 2 times out 10 attemps ...And the big problem is no customer support...n Micromax claim 24*7 service ....I reported complaint 7 days ago but there is no revert from company ...I'm very upset with company ....I'm giving one star bcoz of camera otherwise  zero my side to this product n company	1
It is one of the decent product which was launched by micromaxCamera quality is goodScreen revaluation also very nice.....But battery power is not that much.....	4
I am impressed with this phone after using it couple of weeks.Its best money can buy at this price range.Pros:Camera Shutter speed is fast even in HDR.Photos (both f/b) quality is good.After installing 30 - 40 apps (including fitness apps ) the phone dint slowed down.Battery life is good.Head phone Sound quality is good.Using without a screen protector for more than 20 days but not a single scratch on the screen till now.Love the single swipe search for contacts, apps etc..Cons:Back panel looks too plastic and its finger print magnet.. cant use it without a back cover.The inbox screen protector and back cover is of cheap quality.Accessing quick buttons to enable/disable wifi, Bluetooth etc is a pain.	4
I am sharing this review, after using for around 6 months . First look of this phone is very impressive , after using this for around 6 months , I am facing lot of issues. First thing that it became very slow , and hangs very often. Sometimes I don't see calling screen to receive call, but phone will ring . Mic of phone fas stopped working. I am shouting from my side, other side person is not able to hear. I am using earphone all the time. Service centre guys are literally stupid. My phone is under the garuntee period they are adding extra cost of every thing. It's my last mobile from Micromax. I would recommend don't go with this product atleast.	1
one of the best selfie camera in this price range. ui like iphone. feel good to have this phone.	5
Awesome cameras quality and best display 18:9 HD displayoverall this is a too best phone in this price range.mostly all main feature available in this phone	5

Phone is good for the price range. Charging of the phone is slow.  The quality of camera's are not in consonance with the MP. Overall all a satisfying buy for the price range and over and above an Indian company , Cheers for that.	3
1.IT VERY GOOD PHONE FOR EVERY PERSON *****2.CAMERA PERFORMANCE  IS OUTSTANDING*****3.GAMING IS VERY GOOD****4.BEST FEATURE IN THIS PHONE I OTHER REVIEWS GIVE AFTER USE PROPERLY	5
Looks wise fantastic product.slim n good looking. Only drawback i feel compared to samsung is screen quality n density. 1080 p screen wud be awesome on this phone. n rear camera is ok ok. So if u can ignore screen n rear camera den this is best budget device. Selfie is good n recording as well.	4
Some of person says that this that...  ??????In my review if you want to compare 10k range phone.then is is super phone.I suggest to micromax plz increase batteries and some little work required back camera (because till i am using unite-2 till time & basic phone-x1850).	5
Body is goodScreen is good but briteness is not goodCharge is slowHd games has some lags on screenFront camara is goodRear camera is not good flash is not goodFinger print is goodIn 10000 is good but still not well micromax	4
Best android phone offered by Micromax in 10k .Everything is working as expected.both the cameras are awesome specially front.Device does not lag.Good UI.	5
I love the phone. The built quality the display the sound everything is amazing except that i am facing an issue where memory card is not getting detected. Visit from technical expert is suggested hope Amazon solves this issue by replacing the device.. Once done i would rate 5 for it..	2
I received this phone with earphone, screen guard and back cover.Screen guard is smaller the screen.Phone is awasome as per my experience.Good front camera, lightweight ,good battery and performance. you will definitely love this phone design.Thanks to Micromax this Great product.	5
Nice full value of  money...everything which you want, it is in it. Nice camera nice built quality, battery backup is good infinity display is good.I mean no worries GO FOR IT...	4
this is indeed a good phone it has a good performancePROS:-* superb camera back and forth with dual flash* LED notification indicator* massive 5'7 inches display with curved glass* Efficient fingerprint sensor* Features looks more like that of an iphone* 18:9 aspect ratio(feels like holding a galaxy S8)* Transparent mobile case in the pack* No issues with gaming* Looks beautiful* Its worth 10000CONES:-* Not fast charging* No gorilla glass, tempered glass must be separately purchased* The screen guard that I got in the pack was not sticky	4
A must buy phone considering its price. In love with the  Camera and features provided in that. Stylish looks, good battery backup comparison to its screen size. I'll not forget to mention speaker output also, it's very loud and clear. Cellular call quality is impressive and also work very fine with Jio SIM card.Keep my words, you buy it if your budget is 10k. Don't think about any other phone.	5
Don't buy this phoneAlways get hang. This is the reason the battery is removable	1
Good effort by micromax.But need improvement.processor should be more powerful. like a QC 650,435 OR MTK HELIO.Display should be more brighter.After usage of six months some software issues are found.1.my device is Encrypted. But not Asking for password after restart.2.when I press volume buttons. Icon appears in middle of screen.and freezing.still I touch another area of screen.3.OS is Lagging. Especially disturbs Gaming.4.Some time this phone forget that it have fingerprint scanner also.compulsory u have to use pin.I think update will solve it.I loss my Changing socket in just 6 months of use.Built Qualities should be improved.Nice Camera Both F/R. Portrait mode is excellent.	5
The phone is defective. Tried to convince Amazon to replace. But so far they are not in a mood to oblige	2
Micromax canvas infinity...After using for 3 months really disappointed with device, it's gone hang up when mobile data started sim contacts always loading, battery backup is not good as mentioned.Call receiving problem...	2
1. Awsm phone @ most affordable price.2. All spec r gr8.3. Decent cameras wd both front & rear flash.4. Fingerprint scanner superb.5. Got no heating issues yet...battery lyf gd.6. Upgradable 2 Android Oreo.	5
Worst phn I ever bought.	1
Very bad product charging time up to 8 hour slow and bad performance	1
Initially phone was working fine. But with in week started creating heating issues and also calling feature is not smooth, when we try calling or receive a call screen gets locked and black.  we are not able to disconnect or pick up call. Not able to perform any action once a call is dialled. Seems my money got wasted.	2
Looks good, feels good , works good. 18:9 display, front 16 mp with flash, compact 5.7 inch - all dese features are great to have in this price segment.Day to day usage is great , battry drops tp 30% with al day long usage and internet working throughout fr 24 hrs.To all people complaining about its performance - this is not lagging in that field, well i havent tried any games on it except asphalt 8 , still no lags felt yet, fingrprint works great.Yes , many will say redmi will perform better in this segment, bt for me this one has its own advantages,18:9,front flash,compact yet 5.7 display,NO HYBRID SLOT, 83% screen to body ratio - these dont come in them, even withing 10k.No heating issues as compared to my old beast yureka plus.	5
Build quality is goodLooks premiumCamera is awesomeDisplay is perfectBattery is good9/10	5
Although I bought it from market at same price of Amazon but I am happy to write review here. Well friends, to be very Frank, spending more than 10,000 on a mobile is sheer wastage of money. Many nice phones are available in 10,000 range. Initially I opted for Nokia 5 but when I came across Micromax I found it worth in this price range with numerous features. So far no issue in this phone. This phone has everything new which high end phones provide in 50,000 range. Everything is fine except screen quality bcz screen is slightly dull and yellowish. But at this price it is acceptable. Otherwise every other feature is fine and working normally. Micromax has finally provided quality in this handset. I don't know whether it is an Indian product or Chinese but phone is awesome. It is a combination of both Samsung bezzel less and iPhone x in look wise and app icon design wise. So in end I say, Don,t waste money on expensive phones bcz money saved is money earned. Be Indian, Buy Indian.	5
Impressive phonegood phoneAverage batteryGood selfy cameraGood Looking phonDisplay Aawsomebut I'm Not Satisfied Amazon product delivery Service my order Date 20/09/2017 & Delivery Date 03/10/2017 Strongly very bad Service AmazonGood&fast Service only flipkart	5

Very good productOnly sound system having low sound	5
Good lookAndroid 7.0Front camera 3/5Back camera 3/5Not full HD screenMicromax dual note is better than this in all aspectI give five rating because....if I would have given less rating..my review was not at top...	5
Awesome phone best phone by micromax.. I like it	5
After one month Micromax Infinity phone getting stuck after every minute. We are restarting unit problem not solved.Thinking of exchanging this phone at earliest.Pl revert	1
It's an awesome phone .....* Nyc camera clarity of Front and back both...* Snapdragon processor works completely fine* Screen quality is really awsm* Vr split mode is Missing* Audio quality is decent* Looks are really killer* Fingerprint scanner world completely well* Android 7.1 ...... works completely fine is stabilised* Worth Money product....	5
This is very bad phon .. it was very hang	1
Excellent product at this price. I always love micromax. I have used canvas magnus A117, canvas 4 a210 & now will use this. All earlier models are still in perfect condition but I purchased this for 4G. Will recommend all my friends.	5
Thanks to micromax...one of the best mobile with attractive look with superb camera performance both front and rear....at affordable prices..smooth performance....nice battery backup.....	5
A good phone has been devastated by very bad rear camera ......If you are making good package phone  than make every thing good....No meaning of 18:9 aspect ratio	3
Awesome mobileSuper quality goodMicro max good job next level	5
Perfect One and also with surprising features...Camera  quality is also well this pic captured by my Micromax Infinity...	4
phone is awesome but calculator Redmi4 many difference feature camera quality awesome touch is also good spanshot new system 3fingure down is good	5
Frequently handset getting heated. This is irritating a lot of inconvenience.Called macromax head office to report, but they all saying to stop the running background applications and giving xyz advises.Instead of advises now, they should do all R&D before product lunch and stop paying with customers.	1
this device is not worthy to buy . there is hanging problem, whatsapp often stop automatically, battery also doesn't work properly. There is no app and themes in personlisation, performance optimisation doesn't work. In short device is totally waste material. if you want to waste your money than go for this.	1
Highly disappointed. Front camera 16mp but it is poor than 13mp camera. Screen size 5.7 but it look like less than 5.5. Mobile specifications are good. I suggest to buy other mobile instead of this are else you too get disappoint.	1
Hats off to u Micromax ....grt job.. I m using this phone since 2 days but..I found nothing bad..all things working well..luv this phone	5
I excepted micromax canvas infinity today, isme screen problem aa rahi hai calling nahi ho raha kisi ka call aata hai tau screen me dikhta nahi hai aur calling-ending-loudspeaker etc. Ka option nahi dikhta, I'm so sad , I will go to micromax service center tomorrow	1
Mobile just ok.Display is ok.Heat is normal.But phone little bit lag. Due to entry level processor	3
Camera quality of front & rear is very poor. Phone hanging and heating too much. Battery back is also poor. Taking longer time to recharge the battery . Waste of money	1
Din't work with both Old & New 4G AIRTEL SIMssome SIM socket issue.So, got it replaced with new one.The new replaced oneworks ONLY with Old 4G AIRTEL SIMs (so, I have to be careful with my Airtel SIM to store it for as long as I used this phone)does Not work with New 4G AIRTEL SIMs	1
Display quality very poor...don't buy this product..it's a total money wastage..non refundable..non exchangeable...once you buy this horrible product you are stuck with it..it's not an Indian product...it's made in China..so don't buy this poor quality products phone just because it's made in india	1
It is bogus phone bought from China and Micromax cheating indians. The manufacturer of phone is jhnagjhung......something. The camera of phone is totaly disappointing and resolution is worst. The have inbuilt and feel like toy mobile having only 2, 3 ringtones only. The them is empty and nothing to goodness about	1
Nice phone, but i was think that its screen looking different but its look like normal mobile screen.Camera quality is nice, cheeper price, big storage, big screen,  batarry support 2 days without using net or WiFi, with net.. its support 1 day without any doubt.	4
Please don't ever go for this phone... Front and back camera are good... Look, feel and full vision display of the phone is good.. Apart from the above features you will regret buying this phone... I am using the phone for 3 months now and there is regular connectivity issue.. signal goes blank for some time and then back after some time.... I reboot the phone at least 3-4 times a day as the phone hangs up... Battery is pathetic and only stays for half day with normal internet use... Pls don't buy the phone or will regret	1
Worst phone  I ever had !!! Rear cover almost impossible to open I tried but atlast lost my nail!! Camera quality worst battery back average !! There are far much better option than this phone within this range !!! Also my power switch got damaged while trying to open back cover	1
Excellent packing & Delivery, Nice product good performanceonly negative side observed is Battery consumption too quick	5
Not bad ..its ok ....fine....but no good options ..camera quality is not as 13mp and 16 mp ....sound quality is good ..not 32gb its 22 gb....temp glass and back covr is not available in market.....bettr not buy.....no battry backup...waste dnt buy.	4
Phone lock button is defective. Hang several time. App do not close after closing all pop ups, it's remain in the minimized status. Battery back up is pathetic. Can't delete apps is a big time trouble in this hand set. And many more issues with this model. Just wasted my money.	1
First i recived phone in which speaker was not working properly,  so amazon replaced with new one.After using 15 day second phone now display is not working.after switching ON Screen goes blank off, nothing appears in screen...I need replacement or return it back...	1
Very good cell phone in this price range....happy for buying it... Full paisa vasual,......... Njoy :)	5
Very Good handset. Average call quality. Good built. Battery is OK. Camera is super.	4
Over all performance is fair,but system apps such as calender n clock are not upto  the mark.cant set schedule in calender n there no link for settings in alarm.cant u fix it?what we should do to find a remedy?	3
Everything is good battery is also good,I noticed that in notifications when drag from top to bottom in that when I go from to notifications to icons I means sidewards it is lagging and some lag is there though it is very good phone	4
Sometimes it's doesn't have proper response..	4
Good Features,Front Camera Quality is Good But No Regular Updates... Mobile While Charging Time, Missed Call & Message Alert indicator Not Alert.	4
Simply awesome experience. The new aspect ratio simply makes sense when it comes to one hand usage even with a big screen.	5
Screen garud given with the phone is smaller than the screen	4
If you are a fan of infinity display and have very tight budget then go for it.As you unbox the product you fall in love with the display that micromax has provided in this price range.And great packing by micromax.	5
Superb phone with best selfie camera,best pic in night also	5
Horrible performance. Worthless. No display during calls, and it resumes after ages, most of the time the phone requires to restart.	1
Both  camera  poor  quality  and  battery not  ok  and  not  3g ram and  normal  quality  mobile...	1
Display touch not work properly.This products don't more Run & Selling in market because Indian company Micromax has don't provide Quality. No.1 poor display touch.This is most important.	1
Excellent product from micromax.but better with 5000 battery. Recommend	4
beware for spywares.. preinstalled with spywares.. u ll feel like u bought it to c their ads.each day i hav to uninstall numerous apps/spywares which gets installed automatically.trust me i didn install any other apps other than the spywares and virus preinstalled by micromax. ur phone n datas r not safe with micromax.micromax canvas6	2
This is the best phone I ever used under 15000	5
Don't buy.  not worth for money !  Waste of money ! We think that this is an Indian brand so we need to encourage it !But when it doesn't work properly what us the use of buying ?	1
One of the wrost mobile. I have used a lot of mobile but this one is of the wrost among all of those. Chinese set, inferior mobile. There is a lot of problems in this mobile such as heating problem, auto rotate problem, sound problem, many more problems in this mobile	1
Battery should be more than 3500 MHZ	5
NOTE :@ In this Review I am Explaining its Battery Performance in Detail with all possible data.@ The package includes the Screen Guard & Cover.@ Earphones included are of decent quality.@ There's Dedicated Sim slot in this Phone, so you can use both the sim cards & sd card together.@ I am uploading few Images taken from Rear Camera.I am NOT explaining the overwhelming features of this phone in Detail, which most of the other Reviewers have already explained.Just summing up Key observations, then will explain the Battery stats,Pros:1) Processor coupled with RAM is above average and handles Moderate Level multitasking easily.* Out of 3 GB RAM less than 1.7 GB is free most of the time.2) Good Call Quality and there's NO problem in signal reception.3) Display is also Awesome and similar to LG Q6.4) Internal memory is Average i.e. 32 GB, with 128 GB extendable.* Out of which only 22.31 GB is available.5) Camera Quality is Impressive compared to the price tag.6) Battery Life is above average (check the details below cons for Stats.)7) Finger Print sensor is Lightening Fast.8) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro, compass, etc.9) Has Android Nougat out of the box.Cons:1) NO Fast Charging and charging time is very long.2) NO Image Stabilization, which gives shaky video output.3) Back is bit Slippery.4) Heats alot after 40 mins of usage.5) Ram Consumption by System apps. as usual is High.BATTERY PERFORMANCE STATS :----------------------------------------------------# Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2hrs 15mins. with stock charger.Usage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.)================================================@ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continously ---> 8-10 Hrs.@ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> 18-20 Hrs.@ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 10 Hrs.@ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 6-7 Hrs.@ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 5-5.5 Hrs.@ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 5-6 Hrs.@ Video Playback ---> 9-10 Hrs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VERDICT:If you are fond of Larger screen to body ratio, then certainly go for it. This is good budget phone and very apt alternative to Redmi 4.But if you are avid gamer and Heavy Multi-tasker, then better invest bit more and purchase some good phone like Moto g5s plus, Redmi Note 4, etcThank You for reading this Review.	3
look very nice,good display,good battery no hitting problem,selfie cemra is very good,good job micromax,best phone under 10000,five star.	5

If only one could give negative rating, this is the product that deserves it. Hangs a lot. PM Modi app comes up every time you restart the cell, along with couple of other apps even if you uninstall them, they'll come up later. Touch becomes unresponsive sometimes.	1

This phone is not worth thr price. Just putting latest android software does not make this phone good. Phone to me looks and feels bit filmsy. I bgt it as my mom had never used a smart phone. Display can easily chip of i feel coz i ahd to open the back panel to palce the battery i could sense the screen can break . Also the screen gaurd and back cover cant protect the phone i feel. The scree looks cheap glass. This phone does not seem to be even little durable. Not worth the price . In my opnion this phone should not sell for more than rs 5000 dont go for the screen	1

Excellent product from Micromax	5
I bought it at 1st flash sale on 1st Sept 17. I found this phone very handy and a good value for money.Previously,I was not a FAN of Micromax. But now with this phone, i am.  Micromax renters with a good phone in present competition. I am sharing 10 Pros and only 2 Cons of this phone with 9 days of usage.Pros.1. Big 5.7 inch display with aspect ratio of 18:9. gives rich look to the phone.2. Both front and back cameras are awesome especially front camera is too good.3. it gives 1 day battery backup with normal usage which is good with 2900 mAh Battery and at this price level.4. Customized UI gives feel like iPhone.5. Sound Quality is very clear.6. No heating issue at all.7. One handed handling is possible.8. Micromax promised to provide Android "O" update waiting for it.9. Dedicated SD card slot.That means i can run 2 SIMs and 1 SD Card simultaneously.10. Build quality gives it a "Royal" LookCons-:1. Heavy Gaming not possible2. Sunlight Visibility is poor.	5

I have completed 4 days with Infinity.Look wise and camera quality is good.But Hanging and touch problem arise after sometime.	1
this is the best cell phone in Rs.10000/- budget	5
This product is one of it's kind in this price range. Best phone to buy for 10,000.I'l try to cover all the aspects in the review.1) Looks- Very attractive and good looking phone.2: Screen- Beautifull screen. Curved glass. 5.7 inch screen.3) Processor- Snapdragon 425, does the job pretty well. The phone is smooth, and does not lag at all while multi tasking as well.4) 3 GB ram and 32 GB Internal memory, which is good.5) battery- 2900 Mah battery- Does the job pretty well. Easily last for a day.6)Camera - both the cameras are good, especially the front camera. both sides have flash.7)Less heavy phone comparitively8) Android naughat works well.9) Dedicated slot for sd card is an advantage, back cover can be opened.10)Got good finger print scanner11) Additional Accessories- phone back cover, head phone, screen guard.10) No Cons, to be serious. Worthy for 10,000.GO FOR IT.	5

Very worst product	1
I've fallen in love!Micromax Canvas Infinity.1. its design is augmented .2. its processor is highly speedy.3. display is truly HD.4. memory capacity is much enough .5. at a time we are used  two sim and one memory card6. This is Indian base product ( we are Indian).7. Front Camera its very good.8. Price is Very Goodddddd.8. and finally its a rocking.......	5
It's now 3 days I am using this phone and posting my review based on my experience for that time.The phone is nice to use and I am really satisfied for the price I paid. Amazon packing was not satisfactory but I received the phone way too fast in 2 days.I liked the phone from the very first look. Although the picture of phone on the box and website shows much less bezel as compared to actual device the phone is nice to hold despite having such a big display.Software wise I did not like the preinstalled UI at all and installed Nova launcher the 2nd day itself. Rest I can say the phone does not lag much but you can notice small delay in response if you have used better phones (obviously higher configuration and high price).On the hardware front I really liked the front camera with a selfie flash (not mentioned) the rear camera was just satisfactory. The battery is giving enough juice for more than a full day with moderate use and so I don't miss fast charging much. No heating issue at all is the prime attraction despite having a metal back. The finger print recognition is fair enough as sometimes it does not recognize the finger properly. The back feels premium although I use the back cover provided in the box (it's quite decent). The screen guard is just a waste. Head phone quality is just average. The speaker output is loud and pretty clear. 3 separate slots for 2 sim and SD card is good added benefit.So overall I would surely recommend this phone a musy buy for those who are looking a good phone in low budget.	4

But nice phone in this price total paisa vasool.	3

Not good..1. sms app not working, i couldn't receive or send sms through the phone..2. Amazon customer Care executive couldn't help me.. they are not ready to replace the phone.3. Camera is worst quality..Also it's preloaded Narendra Modi app, that you could not uninstall or disable it.I strongly recommend that not to buy.	2
Great awesomeIt's compared no one... Great sound effects, superb camera, 2days battery backups, nice finger print sensor, 4g net backup one day ... Thank u to micromax great Indian phone... Jaihind....	5
this phone is awesome	5
after two days of using i am writing this reviwMajaor problem is that phone takes 07 Hour for full charging ( Very Slow Charging)  and also heated lots  at the time of using. Games does not run on phone, its stuck on 97% then its not move forward and then phone hanged . I also did software update but there was a no improvement. Camera quality is average in light but poor in night. I got a replacement order on dt 03 but again same problem of battery charge, phone takes 6 hrs and 15 min.for full battery charge, its too much hectic @ amazon look in to matter.	1
This is a very bad product. My buying mobile is not  on and i am very suffering for returning prossess. Very bad experience in buying this product. I think i have not buying in any product in online. And micromax service station experience is also very bad. So i really hurting im this time. Amazon your not provided service in like your tag line and i expected	1
Worst product ever.I purchased this phone some days before. At the time of unboxing the phone it looks so attractive but when started using i got irritated by product.Company is literally cheating customers by attractive advertisements.The issues I'm suffering in this phone are:It gets hang alot alot alot... Fingerprint sensor not working properly.. Takes too much time in charging and it's really irritating in comparison with other normal phonesI'm a Musician and i had a live show a day before and my friend took a video recording of my performance in this phone but the phone speaker is torning the sound.. It's not even sounding proper..Phone mic quality is very much bad and cheaper that it can't withstand with the speakers volume frequency and starts torning sound..Not even single video of my performance is sounding clear.. And it irritated me the most..Don't do mistake of buying..Company reputation is zero after using this handset..Only looks attractive nothing else is good in phone..	1
It is a good mobile. All the facilities of a descent android at a reasonable price.I feel battery backup could have been better.Otherwise nice....	5
Actually I buy this cell from amazon and using it from week as  I observed the second slot of Sim is not working from the second day after buying. The back panel is not good as it must be . All other features are good e.g camera. display. But one thing disappointing about the colour of cell  that it comes in only black colour	3
Phone has major lagging which is not supposed to be in this range of phones.List of issues the software has :-1. Music player shows list of music files which external sd card contain although the card been unmounted.2. If you start internet and there are more number of message to load cell gets hang for some time this is a major disadvantage which i have found in this phone.3. When you delete files with larger number of records the phone gets stuck and delete operation also gets stuck. You have to restart phone to recover from lagging.4. Need some optimization so it does not lag	2
Excellent Handset for this price.But one thing is that Micromax must provide its tempered glass as early as possible.Because we are not getting its accurate glass.	5
Very bad fon plz don't go for it it's screen not 5.7 it's only looking like 4 .5	1
Camera result is very bad.16 mp camera ! They make us foolish.Returning policey is also bad.I tried from last week to replace it.It's china made mob	1
Sluggish Phone, Poor speed, can feel like phone with 3 GB of RAM, apps and camera open at very slow speed,Poor fingerprint scanner, DONT PURCHASE THIS PHONE ....	1
Do not buy ...its touch is not supporting .....properly...only after 20 days of delivery....	1
Amazon indiaMohit Chetnani+91 7878259193I am trying to contact Amazon but now the Amazon customer support is worst.Ordered from +917990366161As soon I ordered the the phone I faced a battery problem on day 2 even I was using the original charger. Then it worked good for next 4 days. Again the problem of battery started. And the camera is the main problem from day 1.Now comes the main  it is the worst thing i can expect from Amazon india.The main thing I can't believe is that the Amazon can do like this as we treat Amazon as our family member..... If you want to support your customer contact  me on +917878259193...+ i facing some times i use phone 20 to 30 mins continuesly than my phone is too much hot. I think amazon cheats me. I think amazon is big brand but no this is wrong....... I want to give this phone to 0 star but there has no option.. I am not satisfied 	1

I purchased Micromax Canvas Infinity on 3rd Sep 2017.Phone gets stuck in the middle of calling or just browsing internet and won't even restart. I need to remove and put back battery to resume phone. It's horrible and (Unfortunately) now there is no replacement.I'm hoping Micromax service centers fix this problem.	1

Worst mobile I had purchase in my life is micromax canvas infinity...mobile gets totaly hang...now I am not able to see screen when call is ringing or incoming call......only within 4 months I m getting these problems....so dont buy this phone..worst phone	1
Not up to the markLess battery lifeAnd old processorBetter go with MI which have same price but performance and battery life is better than this.	2
Definitely Not an infinity display. Don't get fooled by Micromax. Looks good though.	3
I am very much satisfied with the phone in this price range. Can't expect the performance of a higher price range model to be honest. But it's true that Micromax need to work on the battery, otherwise it's a nice phone in this price range.	3
It is good phone phone looking is excellent and the experience is always good because I use before Micromax canvas nitro 2 is very Good phone and it's looking is outstanding so I like Micromax company I like it and love it Thanks	5
Nice product at this price range. Good Value for money. Display and Camera are very good. Battery lasts about 12 hrs.	5

Specifications of the phone is good. But phone is not durable. Jab tak chal jaye chala lo. Kabhi bhi kharab ho sakta hai.	3
camera quality is very poor and its display see like a blur display ...But it's price very unique 9999 so its a good product.	3
This phone is very slow as I'm annoyed using it and battery backup is very poor with it's all very charging don't go for it	1
After use of one week there is network problem need to restart phone within a hour to get network back ..very disappointed	1
Best phone under 10k..... believe me...sd 425 processor and full vision display! 16 mp front camera 12 mp rear camera!! Far better than Opportunity and VIVo	5
It's made in China...which I don't like to keep Chinese mobile.Also it's start hanging even phone memory is empty.Overall I suggest don't buy online it's better to chk at local market.	1
Very Nice product, loved it very much. Superb phone in this price!!well done Micromax, Keep it up!!	5
Good phone, Screen Quality is good. Thanks Amazon for making delivery too fast.Good battery backup, camera and UI is nice.But I got defective earphone, it's increasing and decreasing volume itself continuously, pretty much irritating.	4
AWESOME PHONE... MICROMAX ROCKS...	5
Very bad battery and front camera	1
Nice product easy to use....nice gestures and display	5
Highlights.The Micromax Canvas Infinity has been launched at Rs. 9,999The 18:9 screen is the biggest highlight of this device .For appreciating our efforts you can buy this product from this link also. - http://amzn.to/2EoVbZFA lot of smartphone companies are now designing phones with screens that occupy their entire front surfaces, and nearly no borders. This year's most premium smartphones, including the LG G6, Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy Note 8, have all featured these taller screens. Different brands have their own buzzwords, such as LG calling its screens FullVision while Samsung uses the term Infinity Display, but they all promise more screen and less body. Thankfully, these screens are already being featured on phones at more affordable prices, such as the LG Q6 and the recently unveiled Micromax Canvas Infinity.LG's Q6 has been priced competitively to take on other phones at the Rs. 15,000 level. Micromax, on the other hand, has different aspirations, and has positioned its all-new Canvas Infinity in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment. The company has already confirmed that there will be more models in the Canvas Infinity series.The 18:9 screen is this phone's biggest talking point but is that enough to challenge the competition? At this price level, the Canvas Infinity will have to take on some popular models including the Xiaomi Redmi 4, Nokia 5, Moto G5, and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, all of which offer better hardware. We find out in our review.Micromax Canvas Infinity designIn terms of design, the 18:9 screen is the first thing you'll notice about the Canvas Infinity, and we did feel that this made the phone seem premium. It has rounded corners matching the exterior of the phone. However, we're confused by the official images shared by Micromax at launch time, which show a nearly bezel-less design. In reality, the phone has much thicker borders than seen in its promotional shots, and you'll notice the difference immediately. While the sides are narrow, the top and bottom are quite thick, much more than what we've seen on the premium Galaxy S8 (Review) and LG G6 (Review). Micromax claims that the 83 percent screen-to-body ratio is equivalent to that of the Galaxy S8 series.Rather than having a metal unibody, the back of this phone pops off. It has a removable battery, and dedicated slots for dual Micro-SIMs and a microSD card which is much preferable to having a hybrid dual-SIM slots like most other phones in this category. Micromax has used top-notch plastic on the Canvas Infinity, because it really doesn't feel cheap, and a lot of people around us thought it was metal at first glance. We had no problem using the phone with just one hand, and it fits well within a palm thanks to its size and rounded corners. The narrower screen and relatively thin borders make this feel like a 5.5-inch phone when it actually has a 5.7-inch screen.Like several other phones, there are lines running across the top and bottom of the rear. The power and volume buttons are on the right and are easily accessible with a thumb or forefinger. The Micro-USB port is on the bottom while the 3.5mm audio jack is on top. Much like other phones with 18:9 screens, the Canvas Infinity also uses on-screen navigation keys. The fingerprint scanner is on the back, right below the camera, and there's a Micromax logo towards the bottom. It was easy to reach even when using the phone with one hand.Despite its size and shape, this screen is also a let-down. It has a resolution of 720x1440 pixels and is an IPS panel, but its quality isn't up to the mark. In our opinion, the display on the Canvas Infinity is the least accurate in terms of colours that we have seen in the budget segment for a long time. During the review period, we noticed yellow and bluish tinges when looking at it from the sides, which was annoying. Sunlight legibility was weak as well despite the brightness being pushed up to its maximum. Considering that Micromax plans to launch more phones in the Canvas Infinity series, we hope that the company uses better quality displays. Overall, the Micromax Canvas Infinity keeps its promise of delivering an 18:9 aspect ratio screen in the budget segment, but there are severe tradeoffsInside the box, the company bundles the standard documentation, a transparent back cover, earphones, a charger, a Micro-USB cable, and the phone itself. The Canvas Infinity will be an Amazon India exclusive at launch time but will be made available offline later. Micromax sates that consumers can expect a straight replacement if it is unable to repair any problem with the phone.Micromax Canvas Infinity specifications and softwareThe Micromax Canvas Infinity is powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC clocked at 1.4GHz, coupled with 3GB of RAM. This is the same processor that we've seen powering the entry-level Xiaomi Redmi 4A (Review). There's 32GB of storage which is expandable by up to 128GB using a microSD card. The phone also has a 2900mAh battery that is rated to offer talk time of 20 hours and standby time of 420 hours.At the phone's launch event, Micromax heavily promoted the Canvas Infinity's cameras. This phone sports a 16-megapixel front camera with a soft flash, f/2.0 aperture and face beauty modes. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor with an LED flash and f/2.0 aperture as well. Connectivity options include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth, GPS, AGPS, and OTG support. There's an accelerometer and proximity, light and magnetic sensors as well.The Canvas Infinity runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat with the company's My Launcher on top. This is the most current iteration of Nougat in the budget smartphone market right now, and Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma has confirmed that the Canvas Infinity will be upgraded to Android 8.0 Oreo soon. Unfortunately, my Launcher manages to bury almost all important Nougat features. There are no app shortcuts, quick toggles, or revamped notifications. Only some features, such as split-screen multitasking, direct replies and quick app switching are supported. The phone uses an icon pack that mimics iOS, and the Settings app is clearly inspired by it too. We prefer the custom UI of Micromax's own Yu Yureka Black, which we reviewed few months ago.There is a plethora of bloatware including Apps Centre, Personalise, Videos, and Music, which cannot be deleted. Some of the third-party ones that can be uninstalled are the Narendra Modi, Amazon Shopping and Facebook. The Canvas Infinity is therefore a let-down in terms of software. Our recommendation would be to switch to the Pixel Launcher or use a third-party option like Nova Launcher or Yahoo Aviate.The phone supports Smart Actions which let you do things like wake up or lock the phone by double tapping the screen, flipping it to mute calls and alarms, and automatically accepting calls when you lift the phone to your ear. There are also Smart Gestures which can help launch apps quickly. You use this feature by drawing an alphabet like "O" which launches the camera. We used the Smart Gesture feature and it worked flawlessly. Micromax has also added a one-handed mode which gets enabled when sliding left or right across the navigation bar.Micromax Canvas Infinity camerasThe Micromax Canvas Infinity sports a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, which is being heavily promoted by the company. It has a soft flash, f/2.0 aperture, 5P lens, and comes with face beauty mode. The company is touting the camera's portrait mode which blurs the background similar to the bokeh effect that you can get on phones with dual cameras. Unfortunately, shots taken in portrait mode looked like they were had been Photoshopped with a heavy blur effect, and subjects seemed to have been auto-enhanced with unnatural colours. However, regular selfies were passable and showed good colours with decent amounts of detail in good light. In low-light, selfies were too dark without the soft flash.There's also a 13-megapixel rear camera with an LED flash and f/2.0 aperture. It, too, supports portrait mode though it required some amount of adjustment to get the software to apply its enhancements. Shots taken with the Canvas Infinity came out with pleasant and natural colours under good light. We got some good macro shots, and landscapes were decent. However, we found that high-contrast scenes were often underexposed, which meant a loss of detail in the shadows.When zooming in to 100 percent, the Micromax Canvas Infinity photo samples showed noise but were still passable for social media posts. Autofocus works accurately in good light though you will have to do it manually in low-light situations.Unfortunately, the low-light performance of both cameras is below par. Both the front and rear cameras need some amount of direct light around to illuminate images or they end up looking too dark with heavy noise across the entire image and minimal details.We liked the camera app on the Canvas Infinity, which had most options just one tap away. With the camera roll feature, you can take a look at the last photo you took without the need to close the main app. There's a feature called Super Pixel which takes multiple shots at the same time and combines them to give you a higher resolution and more detail. We noticed that images taken with Super Pixel were better than regular shots, though they looked a little artificial.Micromax Canvas Infinity performanceWe have reviewed several phones with the Snapdragon 425 SoC, and they have all performed decently. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Micromax Canvas Infinity which was sluggish right from the start. We encountered slow responses to our touch inputs which is something we don't expect from phones at this price anymore. We also faced app crashes on the Canvas Infinity which affected usability. We blame the My Launcher UI in part for the phone's sluggish performance. It's worth noting that the phone responded better when using a third-party launchers.Thanks to the extended screen space, we found it easier to use GPS navigation and multitask with two apps simultaneously on the Canvas Infinity. No metal in the body meant that the phone didn't get too warm, which is a good thing. We used the phone extensively for watching videos and didn't feel it heating then either.We can't recommend the Canvas Infinity for gaming enthusiasts, however, as the phone stutters while playing heavy games such as Marvel: Contest of Champions and Asphalt 8: Airborne. Lighter titles like Angry Birds, Temple Run 2, and Subway Surfers were playable without any issues.The Micromax Canvas Infinity managed 36,753 in AnTuTu, 13fps in GFX Bench, 3,649 in 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme, and 10,925 in Quadrant.Calls were clear and the bundled earphones were relatively good. Unfortunately, the speaker wasn't loud or clear enough, and its placement at the back meant that you might not hear it at all if the phone is left on a soft surface. We were able to make VoLTE (voice over LTE) calls using a Jio SIM on the Canvas Infinity. The phone, however, doesn't support direct 4G video calling, a feature being offered by Reliance Jio. Both SIMs can work on 4G networks, though only one at a time.Micromax Canvas Infinity battery lifeThe removable 2900mAh battery is claimed to deliver up to 420 hours of standby time and up to 20 hours of talk time. In reality, the phone did actually last for roughly 20 hours with heavy usage. During our review, we used the phone heavily for watching videos and streaming media, and the battery did well overall. In our standard HD video loop test, it lasted for 10 hours and 20 minutes, which is good enough for a battery of this size. There's no fast charging, and the Micromaxa Canvas Infinity took roughly two hours to charge fully.VerdictPriced at Rs. 9,999, the Micromax Canvas Infinity tries to bring an 18:9 display to the budget market. While we have to commend Micromax for trying, this phone definitely falls short in many areas. Despite the display being this phone's highlight, it is also its biggest disappointment. The My Launcher skin is buggy and performance is sluggish. If you're in the market for a sub-Rs. 10,000 Android smartphone, you should look at other options such as the Xiaomi Redmi 4 (Review), Moto G5 (Review), Nokia 5, or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review), all of which have better hardware at around the same price. If you still want a smartphone with 18:9 display just because it's something new, then you should save up some money and go for the LG Q6 (Review) instead.	4
Micromax has really done a comeback. Screen brightness is not low as said in reviews, user interface is very good like moto x play( 16000 inr phone) , camera quality is wonderful more than mi phones of this range under 15k , very slim in look , easy to handle . I have used moto x play and mi note 4 . Overall I rate it better than them . A good indian brand phone and feel of infinity display is awesome . Better than any chinese brand of same price tag . Best phone for medium use people who use internet and all . I have not tried gaming . But what do u expect from. 10k phone Xbox.. overall rating is wonderful ...	5

Great mobile in this price.. excellent camera..which no one vl offer under this price..using it for 7 months..no complain..smooth running.	5
Pathetic user interface . Lots of touch required to access any single details. I don't want modi app and also asphalt nitro.Everytime I un install and re boot the phone both apps are again installed automatically.Is it that now Micromax will decide what app to install and remove. I am feeling like a slave for Micromax .2 star only for looks	2
Amazing screen,perfect selfie.......Good Work	5
It's a good phone for the price but you will feel the lack of performance and bad Micromax software that has some problems otherwise the phone is good.	3
I lost my canvas infinity somebody help me to find my phone	3
i just hate it .now i think amazon is a very bad company it just sell us old items and defective ones.within 6 months my mobile is damaged.	1
Made in China product of Indian company never compet with make in India product of chinees company When will our company improve themselves	1
This is a awesom phone at this price....	5
Heating issues and battery drain out .	2
Best awesome and lovely product by micromax just loving it.Much more better and effective than MiPerson having buget of 10k should buy only this phone	5
Very Nice LookingAppreciatable Camera QualityBRILLIANT Finger SensorOne hand mode BestBatterylife good. Charging SlowOverAll Good Zabardast	5
I want to exchange my micromax infinity but it is not showing....	2
i have used this phone and after thoroughly using it am giving this review.according to me this is a beautifully crafted super slim, powerful and super strong phone. it is coupled wit 3 gb of ram along with 1.4 GHz cortex a53 quad core processor which makes this phone powerful on performance and  a great battery effecient. at first looking at its processor i thought that it would be a problem of slow processing and hangs but believe me its a miracle. despite of having a slower processor than other phones it really fast and is quite of a compitation to other phones at this price range. now coming to its display its really amazing to have a phone with bazleless display. its display is totally frol right to left. there is no unused spaces at d sides... it is totally covered by the display.now coming to its cameras... this phone has very good cameras. the rear camera is 13 MP with f2.0 apperature which takes great pictures even in low light as it is coupled with a very bright LED flash. coming to the front camera it has a 16 MP selfie camera of f2.0 apperature with 16 beautification modes and is also coupled with a bright selfie flash.now coming to the side features it has a 2800 mAh removable battery and micrimax has done a very good work in this phone nd that is to make this battery of international quality. so this battery is of very good quality. it has a dedicated slot for its 2 sim cards and a microsd card which is missing in most recent phones. it supports OTG and has a very good international ranking.ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE AND THIS PHONE WILL NOT FAIL ITS CUSTOMERS AND THE SERVICE OF MICROMAX HAS BEEN IMPROVED TO A GREAT EXTENT.	5
The infinity is the highlight feature of this phone.It offers 3gb of ram and 32gb of storage .It has a 5.7 inch Hd display which is quite impressive.2900Mah battery is a let down .425 Snapdragon has some heating issues.Overall a okay phonePlease like if you found it helpful	3
awesome phone for this priceing	5
Hanging issue	3
Just Like Samsung Micromax Launched It's Infinity Display Mobile Phone In This Competitive Market.These Are My Personal Inspection.Here Are Some Pros And Cons:Pros:18:9 Screen At A Low PriceCompact PhoneDedicated SIM And MicroSD Card SlotsCons:Display Quality Is Below ParCustom UI is BuggyPerformance Is Sluggish	3
A very nice phone after a long period. With infinity display and loud volume. A must have phone	5
It is good in performance no doubt, i have used several micromax mblsBut look is worst in ten thousand.. It is just like wearing no gold nd diamond rings but the dressing sense is like a beggar...In ten thiusand comp must give metallic body nd dynmic look	3

Nice phone in a budget range value for money product it could be snapdragon 625 instead of 425 but i bought for my mom for a basic use so thats ok!	4
Mobile software is very poor and again problem continue camera quality is running and no megapixel total review poor.	3
Phone is good but battery back up is not good... Battery back up is so short...	4

Pathetic phone.I switched it on and it hanged, had to remove the battery and switch it on again after putting the battery back.While typing a message the typed alphabet appears after almost 15-16 seconds.Sound is also not upto the mark.Amazon is not even ready to refund.	1
Best phone in this this price range.	5

It is excellent	5
Awesome deal...loved it	5
Awesome phone no lags till now....and overall it looks premium....highly recommended	5
here's an honest review .. two stars only coz of laggy UI and amazon's return policy .. phone over all is okay not that bad .. camera and screen and other stuff is fine.. whats not fine is its keep getting crashed and lags alot like hell.. as for the phone i would add more cash and buy a different and better phone with more ram and strong processor... i requested for my refund but amazon is only providing replacement ..means same device with same lagging issues and dumb UI .. i hope i get my money back  and get a new phone.	2
Super phone........I love it	5
It was completely worth buying a phone like this....For just 10K....	5

Terribly disappointed, had ordered the phone during the big sale got it in time but was defective. Basic function like calling was hampered, person on the other end couldn't hear your voice. Plus getting a return takes hell lot of time, refund expected but all I'm getting is a replacement for this phone.	1
Guys, this phone has network issues.. It is not able to detect sims, Many of my friends also faced the issue and we've returned the device. We've confirmed the same by inserting the same sim in different phones and they're working fine. Just think about this before buying	2
Photos not stored in both Phone & SD card.Mobile get hang.	1
I have bought this mobile one week ago and i think i have wasted my money because tge battery backup is not very good and poor camera quality. It is a good looking phone but its features Are below average.	1

NOTE :@ In this Review I am Explaining its Battery Performance in Detail with all possible data.@ The package includes the Screen Guard & Cover.@ Earphones included are of decent quality.@ There's Dedicated Sim slot in this Phone, so you can use both the sim cards & sd card together.@ I am uploading few Images taken from Rear Camera.I am NOT explaining the overwhelming features of this phone in Detail, which most of the other Reviewers have already explained.Just summing up Key observations, then will explain the Battery stats,Pros:1) Processor coupled with RAM is above average and handles Moderate Level multitasking easily.* Out of 3 GB RAM less than 1.7 GB is free most of the time.2) Good Call Quality and there's NO problem in signal reception.3) Display is also Awesome and similar to LG Q6.4) Internal memory is Average i.e. 32 GB, with 128 GB extendable.* Out of which only 22.31 GB is available.5) Camera Quality is Impressive compared to the price tag.6) Battery Life is above average (check the details below cons for Stats.)7) Finger Print sensor is Lightening Fast.8) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro, compass, etc.9) Has Android Nougat out of the box.Cons:1) NO Fast Charging and charging time is very long.2) NO Image Stabilization, which gives shaky video output.3) Back is bit Slippery.4) Heats alot after 40 mins of usage.5) Ram Consumption by System apps. as usual is High.BATTERY PERFORMANCE STATS :----------------------------------------------------# Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2hrs 15mins. with stock charger.Usage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.)================================================@ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continously ---> 8-10 Hrs.@ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> 18-20 Hrs.@ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 10 Hrs.@ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 6-7 Hrs.@ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 5-5.5 Hrs.@ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 5-6 Hrs.@ Video Playback ---> 9-10 Hrs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VERDICT:If you are fond of Larger screen to body ratio, then certainly go for it. This is good budget phone and very apt alternative to Redmi 4.But if you are avid gamer and Heavy Multi-tasker, then better invest bit more and purchase some good phone like Moto g5s plus, Redmi Note 4, etcThank You for reading this Review	5

It was a pathetic experience of buying mobile from amazon.I would not suggest any  to buy any product from this site.First time I purchased this item (Micromax Canvas Infinity),It was hanging at the first day & Brightness was so less you can not see anything in sunlight & Camera of this phone (rear & front ) are pathetic,After their engineer verified all defects they returned the products ,When i received the new product battery was missing.I was so pissed off i asked for refund.I thought it's trusted company will initiate refund if anyone pissed of any product.But they refused to refund.So i suggest you guys never buy any product from this site.They are just looting like anything.	1
How to make calls in this mobile without jio 4g voice calling app	4
Hi Guysi love this phone i did not purchased from amazon but still i like it very much and i want to review it.I purchased it offline @ INR 9500/- the phone is working awesome and i am enjoying it games run smoothly no hanging problem camera quality is awesome i also have VIVO V5s and i compare both camera and i find both processing same kind of pictures.	5
Excellent product for the price. I'm extremely happy with its battery performance.	4
Its supercool device with full view and many more features.I will skip the features which are explained in many reviews. I am always looking for something innovative in smart phones. and here in Infinity I found some cool features to declare it as real smart one.Feature which are not mentioned in reviews are need to be highlighted. Smart gesture you can use to configure shortcuts to many app or actions.I have made 10 smart gesture for YouTube ,Gmail, gallery, calling to a number and bank app etc. Finger print sensor is also can be used for opening an app or call to number or send message to a number. And one more features to boost for is voice and face unlock. It work very well.	4

Very Good Experience with new mobile	5
Though cameras performance can not be doubted but you shoot video and playing back, audio/sound very poor.Though option to add language to your choice is there other than English/Hindi but despite of adding Punjabi for instance, keyboard does not appear.English/ Hindi ate default language only and other language does not support. It is a made in China product.Purchased couple of days back only, so can not comment much and unaware issues come in future. Service centre staff not attending politely.	2
Very good phone	5
Best product after 10 days of use.	5

I have received the phone by Amazon on 4  11 2017 nd I did not received back procetive cover in my box which I had complained to customer care but no response nd have also written a letter to supplier cloudtail India Bangalore but no response,  worst phone I have purchased in my life I will give ooooooooo point to Micromax infinity I had seen the adv of Micromax infinity launch by CEO of Micromax nd had purchased it ..............but I got very bad experience .......... It is totally opposite what ever told by Ruhul Sharma CEO of Micromax at the launch of infinity mobile, pls do not by this type of products by only seeing a adv. I had taken my I phone 6 nd also this micromax infinity mobile to Dubai tour from 6 to 12 Nov nd I shot all photo in this camera instead of I phone the photo taken in Dubai tour we're tottaly waist very very dissapointed not even 1 photo of 500 taken came nice at all I am thinking of taking a legal action agaisnt them....... They waisted my life memories of Dubai and waisted my time no reply from Amazon nor from Micromax I am thinking a legal complaint through cosumber court	1
Micromax infinity is excellent smartphone off the range comper to other brand mobile phone excellent battery backup Nice look Nice camera m advices other people purchrge this Nice smartphone	5
The Phone is Vary Badly Hack And Betrry Was Vary Bad.	1
Phone look very nice ....But Head phone quality is very bad...And head phone jak is not working well and sound is very low when connected to car system or any other sound system	3
You mean infinity like Samsung, I know it's worth it's price, but this absolutely is not a infinity display, nothing compared to s8 infinity. This phone is just a bulky, battery forever, not that great gaming, camera okay,  budget phone at 10K, so ya !!	3
In love wid slik design ...the first micromax phone i have buy in my life and found it amazing....such a good responsive touch...such a amazing display.....best budget smartphone under 10000...micromax show the chinese that we have the power to beat u...make in india	5
One of the best product in this price	5
Worst phone i have ever seen. Actual design of Mobile is Different from the image they shown on Amazon and mobile Box. Performance is also bad.	1
Superb mobile at 10000 price .Only need big battery life than perfect mobile.	4
When doing a call not be possible to disconnet, touch not work proper most of the time using multiple, game not play proper	1
Battery backup best hCamera selfie ke liye jyada behtar h aur rear cam ka hdr mode me acchi pic aati hOverall best phone hai is range me	5
Hi Guys,Totally waste of money Plz dont buy it.Its take 5 hours to charging & battery is lasting maximum 4 hours...	1
Really Good Phone in this Price. Camera and Display are awesome. But It is not good for powerful Game after all everything is good	5
Its a good product in this price range. The camera is a prime factor of this device. The display is HD, not full Hd still excellent even in bright daylight condition. The battery is fine for a day use with a good amount of gaming, videos and net surfing. However, Micromax should have given a better processor for a full 5 star review	4
I love the full vision display on the phone! And the front camera is killer for selfies. A good option to go for in this price range.	5
Wrost phone	1
Within a month problem has started in the phone. Screen becomes black when a call is made from the other side. also it takes a lot of time to open the screen after  pressing the keys. I had expected a better product from Micromax .	1
Amazing phone, superb battery backup, HD big screen, affordable price.overall best phone in the market in lowest price.	5
Good job	5
It's not perfect phone on display.	1
Amazing product. Keep the spirit up MICROMAX.	5
Very Good Phone in such a low price, All fetures of this mobile are amazing. Strongly recomonded to buy this Mobile.	5
Look like curved display, nice camera overallAgr mi note 4 kharid rhe ho to Bhai processing k alawaba kuch khas nhi milega jisne mera phn dekha gzb bataya h & support India yrr....	5
Worst quality & performance, during start of  mobile data at that time very slow performance and during using of memory card gives slow performance. Battery backup is worst and ear phones cheap quality. Again and again hanging. So see all ratings before buy this product.	1
Hanging problem working procecer very slow	1
Received a faulty product twice, phone does not get switched on without charger being attached.	1

I bought this mobile from Amazon.from 2nd day onwards the phone started hanging and sometimes network issue..not gud for those who is  internet freak..And as per Amazon policy they can exchange with same new peice.but I don't want to buy the same mobile after my experience.	1
Hello guys,I had rated 1 star in my earlier review. Actually I had got a defctive phone, I then returned it to Amazon, now I received a good device. Am using it since one week, till now it's not hanging or heating problem. Overall its a good phone. Worth buying.Thank you Amazon for returning a product.	4
Micromax shame on you.Why is Narendra Modi's apps is there in the mobile. How much money paid Modi to you to do so. Please dont do it in the future. I am planning to return it.Very shame to you.	1
I just 10 days ago bought this phone now this phone has started screen touch problems.Battery life is 5 to 8 hours if u listener , watching video's or chat on social media .So my review is don't waste money. Put 2 to 3k more and get another good phone.	1
Super phone from micromax, amazing looks, nice camera	5
Awesome display,  great perfromance and supreb picture quality... Well done micromax and amazon too..  India k sapno ki apni dukaan:-)	5

Pathetic sound quality in earphones u can't hear more than 5 min u will get headacheThey offered much in 10k but little more would have been better n they cl u to write it review	1
processor is tooo old and very slow.....picture quality is not good...pixels are not good as have to be	1
Damaged products heating mobile when playing game and direct call received when mobile in pocket	1
Worst sound quality. Cannot even hear out of the mic during a call. Refrained to using speaker in public which is an inconvenience. Micromax support is another nightmare. Made me wait 10-15 mins twice before cutting the call mid way. Keep away.	1
worst mobile battery is not working properly it became hot during usage customer caaaare service is not good	1
It's just ok, camera not better quality and UI is not friendly, I am not set my photo on main screen. Other features are just good speed nice and lastly audio quality is also good noise less.	3
Got a made in China phone. So much for trying to support Indian brands...	1
Defective.. Video call is not clear and audio too	1
Guys, I bought this product on first sale. Till today it was good woth money I thought, but since yesterday my back camera stopped working in the sence it is only showing front camera flip to back camera is not working. Please suggest me how to fix... Thanks in advance.	2
Best Mobile with best features at this price....it's an Indian brand.....beats the Chinese products.....don't encourage Chinese brands likeMI & Lenovo.....use Indian brands	5
I have received this phone today in the evening and I m just fed up of it.Suffering from a lot of sim card issues like sim not detecting or lost network.The phone is lagging a lot. I am not abe to call anyone every time I have to reboot my phone.And EARPHONE is no working at all.I want to return this product today itself.Update: I have requested for replacement on 9th as there is no direct return policy.The other phone was also not working properly. So now I have returned the producAND GOT REFUND.	1
Bhut acha product h or company k brands se to kaafi acha h	5
Good phone.i am iPhone user but this pH is a replica of iPhone 10 almost	5
I have purchased it from 1st sell. Back camera is average.But there is nothing like infinity or bassel screen. It's normal. It's only become mamu type of people...	2
Amazing camera and display.Battery lasts for complete day. India ka S8.	5
I wasn't happy with the delivery as phone was received after 2days from expected delivery date and that too after calling their service center 3 times..When I received the package and opened it, I was flattered by the look of the mobile..keeping it small...overall the performance of the phone was nice comparing to other brands at this range.Camera- 9/10 details are quite nice..even after zoomingSound - 7/10 is similar to other phonesDisplay - 10/10 nice display..feels like a premium phone..also visible under bright sunlightBuilt - 8/10 - avg nicePerformance (non-gaming) - 8/10 - no lag nothing else.. took some time to open Gmail and contacts..maybe due to it was syncing at that timePerformance (gaming) - 7/10 - if you play normal games like coc, CR, NFS etc then no issue..but when play games like modern warfare then it heats up and lag.Overall (for the price range) 8/10- nice phone and first phone made by micromax not rebranded.	5
Hopeless phone, and worst amazon customer care center.	1
Very very bad product, many time goes to hang or not working properly spicily touch pad not working on time to time.	1
Worst mobile.  Lot of problems  , no proper customer service no exchange or return option.  Don't buy such stupid mobiles.	1
Bad product	1
A great smartphone from Micromax, infinity display on a budget. This infinity display are mostly on high end phones but, Micromax did a great job bringing budget or value for money phone with this display.I'm very happy with the smartphone.	5
Best budget smartphone but processing is little bit slow hang too much	2
Don't buy	2
I'm interested in buying Micromax infinity White Colour coming chances are there	5
Proximity sensor problem in this..After purchaging two days...when i calls someone..screen automatically off..and blank..utill call finished by someone..so don't buy it totally waste of money and time..	1
Cameras are goodNoticeable laggingThe charger which I got along with this is horrible. Kept for 2 hours, charge increased from 32% to only 57%.	3
One of best features... But battery was not acceptable... Low mah then other mobiles...but remaining all are excellent	4
This is a BJP phone...shocked, I am telling this because this phone has a pre-installed apps called "Narendra Modi". You can uninstall that but after restart it will automatically reinstall.	3
Gorgeous budget Mobile awesome features , but only problem is screen.will break easily.camera excellent	4
Camera is ok but the phone hangs so much.even while playing a 300mb game. I just wasted my money on this phone.	1
Worst phone no replacement	1
It's is good for the infnity display. If you want to experience infinty display you can give a veiw on this..	5
Worst phone with poorest system ui....hangs whenever connected to any wifi or internet connection.....when task manager opened it hangs and switch off.Worst phone from Micromax....not expected that..	1
More than decent for the price point of 10000	5
Awesome is the word that explains this phone	5
Surely I will rate this one of the worst product from micromax, hell of my tenure with this mobile, damn waste of Rs.10,000/- please never think of this mobile in dream also.	1
Mobile hanging.  Having some problems also.Service center not supported. Amazon people also not help to me.totally I'm  disoppinting to buy this mobile.	3

It's seems that I have been cheated.... I m not going to order any from Amazon again.. if I help me in this matter than it will be great.....	1
Have been using this phone for over a month and have faced zero issues. The display is just amazing and rest you all can figure..	5
Simply WOW  mobile....best camera and amazing experience with this phone...This is the best buy with 9,999.Just go for it...	5
Bought the phone for its camera and display.. bt see the truth.. the camera app sometimes doesn't work.. it neither clicks photos nor delets them.. its berry irritating.. i need to reboot it all the time.. I hope Amazon see in this matter..	3
How to book....	3

OVER HANGED AND OVER HEATING MOBILE PLEASE DONT BUY	1
Micromax service fees is good but for gaming it is not that great but overall display is awesome ok for budget. after 21/9/17 today I went to service centre my loud speaker cracking sound worst experience they didn't now about infinity model they refuse to service my handset. Customer support is saying go from vijayawada capital of Andhra Pradesh  to Visakhapatnam 500km to service normal city Micromax is bogus company Chinese scrapDon't buy b	1
Micromax has built a nice phone after a long time.Also included a fingerprint sensor which lg has not provided. Processor is littoe bit average but not bad. Performence is good. Screen is 720p. Cameras are average. Overall a nice phone . Not for gamers.for basic users and little gamers.	3
Best phone for daily use. I got it for my father.	5
Not good very slowly working	1
Its only 9999 on everywhere	1
this is very bad purchase.... applications keep downloading again and again even though i delete them.. the fingerprint  scanner is okay but nothing great... the infinity display which is the USP is a mess, its not at all a infinity display and is just a normal display.  ... it is not at all what pictures show us... cameras with 13 MP and 16 MP is as good as a 5 MP and 8 MP.please do not buy this at all.	1
Very good phone in all things display weight is good light weight camera supper duper	5
Fantastic product. Ahead of his time. Will definitely give a run for moneyTo other Chinese handsets company.	5
To be very frank, the product looks really good and that's it. Nothing else really makes it worth buying.1. Display is huge, and as described the screen to body ratio makes it look good. But the low resolution of 720p hits the main USP of the device.2. UI is a complete Chinese crap. I don't see even a tiny bit of work that has gone into making of the UI. The whole UI design is totally inspired, you can even call it copied, by iOS. Even the tiniest of things like icons are not original. The UI is very sluggish, and I don't seem to see that Micromax is even slightly concerned with their costumers experience with their so called "COMEBACK PHONE", which is one of the main reasons I hate this phone.3. You'll some times feel that you are using a decade old phone with low performing hardware. Its feels like there is no coordination between the Snapdragon 625 and the Chinese crap UI. You'll surely not enjoy the roughness in the UI.4. Cameras are acceptable considering the price at which they are offered.5. Battery seems to be average.	1
Worst quality.....camera is absolutly waste	1
Battery low camera Goot	4
Screen turns on after 10seconds when I pressed power button.Never seen charging reaches morethan 60% even after over night charging also.Amazon is royally robbing people money with that worst smartCHK app.	1
Nice product in this price range. Amazing Features..Decent camera..No hanging..Good battery backup..	5
Camera is not good..	1
Must Buy, awesome phone in this range-Looks like Iphone7fully loaded with good GUI.	5
Its a nice phone. How good it is depends upon each persons daily use. I would say its money worth.	4
Worst mobile ever...just want to say cheated by Micromax...never trust an Indian company as they used to selling craps...first 6 days no problem, gradually started after that..phone turns on automatically while charging,hangs during phone call...telling the lie that promised here for 24 hour assistance..and the bpo person saying service center me le ke jaiye...sasta phone lenewalo ke time bhi sasta hota hay...ye phone lo aur chutia bano...Micromax ke sath chutia bano phone ke sath....	1
Not a Good Phone.Phone Hang on 3GB Ram,Network is major issue with this device.13MP camera is not that clear.Not worth of money	1

Not functioning properly.Not able to surf net. Even no media file is opening. PL call back want to return this item	1
Srry to say ...but I'm unhappy that time with Micromax ...camera is so blurry and display infinity but not brighter and  resolution very poor	1
Do not buy this product, Micromax is a big cheater. This model is totally different from what they have advertised or shown in the picture. This is not a bezel less phone.	1
I want this  phone But not buy	5
This is very disappointing phone in terms of camera quality, Display, and battery. If you are selfie lover than this is not one for you. Even when I ask Amazon to refund my hard earned money they simply told that there is no policy for the refund.	1
I don't purchase China made. I purchased today but learnt from Utube and Guggle that it is made in China and packge shows it made in China. China has occupied Indian land in 1962 war. Again supporting n funding Pak.	1
Very good and camera clarity is awesome	3
This mobile very very poor and toomauch cost don't purchase and no full vision,also no feature, performance came also very bad 16 mega	1

msstttt	5
Good product	5
Good phone for this price.	5
Value for money	5
At this price rate this phone best...when you  will update it...this phone will work more faster and well...a little copy of I phone... Look is killer.. and camera quality is also at fire level.. my friend Mi and oppo hangovers in front of Micromx canvas infinity... Phone is best as compared to cost of phone... I my views phone is best.. some people expect tooo much in this cost but phone is best at its level....  #Amazon and #Micromax .....good deal.. i liked it...	5
Phone performance is very good.. Btry is long lasting...  And micromax earphone are bass beast.. Above expectations.	4
Best Indian mobile in Rs 9999 working as expected. Removable battery+Front Flash Light+16MP Selfie Camera.	5
Camera is superb, best part is screen it 5.7'' but size of the phone is smaller or same as of 5.5'' phone. As per battery is concern with normal use come more than 24h.Overall this time micromax done their job well.	5
Update: "Possibly the worst phone I have ever bought. It keeps installing software by itself. Can't turn off this app centre which keeps sending notifications and installing all kinds of apps. So irritating."Processor is not the best, notice some heavy apps are little slow, but general day to day performance is good. Does the job.Camera is pretty impressive for the price. Software portrait mode works sometimes, sometimes not. Need good lighting for it. When it works its nice. Is there on front and back cameras.Lightweight. Good screen. Only 720p but 18:9 is sweet. Battery is quite good. I get 5.5 hours SoT every time.Better processor would have been killer but overall very happy at this price.	2
After using it for a month almost looks like you can blindly opt for this at this price range. With 3 GB of RAM it's good for multitasking. No heat issues yet and also the performance seems to be flawless.	5
Extremely fast phone in low price. Phone looks awesome without cover. Body is made up of aluminum and plastic makes phone cool while using 4G. Because of long & slim body I don't need to use my other hand. 128 GB is too much for my heavy duty (lossless) song list. And Sound out put is very good. But ear phone with handset is not great but good. Must take it before offer is over on Amazon.  Thanks for Amazon in One day delivery.	5
Good phone.good look. I have used more than 3 month. No heating. Camera is average. battery is only 2900 is the only fault i feel. Overall great product	5
Owsome Phone.. Value for money...Best phone .. Great Features...Finger Lock is Super Fast.. Many More Features than Phones costing more than 16k...	4
Initially while going through the comments I wondered that many people Have write a negative review but now I realised that it is a worst phone hanging issues touch sensor not work ing properly .rear camera is of poor quality while we switched it to video mode .touch is also poor . initially I have wrote a good comment after using it for 3month I found this much of complaints .so dear friends don't buy this phone.choose another brand pleeees don't buy it's a request	1
i have been using it now for 10 days....good mobile in this price...MADE IN INDIA...Micromax we love you...good camera ...best camera in 9.5K ...good internet connectivity...touch screen is good...fone looks good...all the features that u get in a 15k mobile,you are getting it in around 9.5K price in this......Long live India...Long live Made in India Micromax..Jai Hind	5
The phone looks premium. No issues. Good at 10k. The display is not the best though.	5
Good Phone at this budget.1st Time Micromax Sell a Good Product with All Satisfying Specifications.Good performance,good camera quality,good and large infinity display like Samsun,and battery performance be good.I definitely recommend for this phoneGuys Must Buy This phone.	5
This smartphone doesn't serve the basic purpose of a phone which is dialing and receiving calls. The voice is never clear. I would like to return the same.	1
Amazing product by micromax ,it's very impressive and stylish phone under 10000.why this phone is best just sree.1.infinity display 18:9 it's awesome .2.front camera with flash and portrait mode 3.smart gesture.4.Smart action.5.finger print sensor.In this range it's awesome it's unbeatable.	5
Surprise package from Micromax,I am not expecting such a good phone in this price range from Micromax, display looking is stunning,phone performance is also good.batery back up is good for normal user.and thanks for Micromax for great product in this price range.please buy it because of an Indian company compete to Chinese on quality.	5
Awesome product. Only complaint is that the soft buttons for home, recent and back are occupying space from the promised 18:9 screen. This is only happening when any app is open. Home screen (Desktop) looks perfect. This is such a minor issue, that I do not want to reduce the rating for the overall product.Best buy, for the price...	5
I have been using this phone for last 10 days and below are my comments on this phone:Pros:1. Display is good with vibrant colors while using camera and watching videos/movies2. Battery lasts easily for a day3. Jio sim works without any issue4. Good phone in the price segment of INR. 10000/-5. Good looking phoneCons:1. Speaker output and quality could have been better2. Display brightness could have been better as visibility is poor in sun/outdoor conditions even with full brightness settings!3. Restarting the mobile takes almost 80 to 90 seconds - May be software needs fine tuning4. Audio of the videos recorded from front camera is very poor! Rear camera audio is good but lacks optical image stabilization.5. The UI could have been better. Today I got an an SMS on software upgrade/patch available but System Update doesn't reflect the same - I am unsure on how to upgrade!Apart from these, there is no clear cut details on how to get 30gb JIO offer and 375/- Kindle books free offer!Also looking for good tempered glass with back case but couldn't find one.	4
My self is the early buying of this product, Nice product in this cost, Processor speed, Both the Camera( Front & Rare) is also very good,With Internet life of battery is upto 8-9 hours, without internet amost 15-18 hours. Easy to handle in bigger screen also.Nice product	5
I give 5 stars and excellent to Micromax infinity. I am a loyal customer of Micromax shifted from Micromax a114 to infinity. Micromax made a master piece at such pricing which is worth buying. I find lot of clarity on voice calls, high speed connectivity on 4g and clean, simple user interface. Super phone at this price range.	5
The phone is really awesome. Touch is so smooth ,Front Camera is the best but the back one is not so good like front, buts it's fine,I don't like its own theme launcher so I changed it to another launcher, Battery wise its good, its don't have quick charging option still it charges the phone very fast, while buying this I was thinking about phone resolution is too low but the display quality is very good I couldn't find a lot diff bw 1080px screen and its screen	5
Both Camera is goodBattery is good one dayDisplay is fine but not full hd feel like 5 inch display.Sometimes apps close automatically...Sound is very slow and very bad sound quality....	3
All the features are good, performance of mobile is also good but when it's about battery is very poor because if you using mobile constantly 3 hours this mobile battery get low but in this mobile the problem is there only of battery .All the things are made good and screen look fab. People should buy this mobile and use it.	4
Performance is very good. The brand is Micromax, though comparing with other Chinese brands, the smartphone's hardware is quite good. The battery backup is awesome. Using Jio 4g 24 hrs. in 1st slot with data on all the time & Idea 3g in the other, the device is giving at about 20 hrs. of back up in average. I haven't tried any games yet. But watching movies online, listening music, browsing web & of course using facebook, what'app very heavily, the phone is running flawlessly & without any lag. Snapdragon 425 SOC is impressive. Though it is quad core processor, I haven't felt any lagging till date. It should be noted that the phone has a great camera both rear and front. The front camera has flash also and it is quite good. Last of all the display is 5.7 inches with 18:9 ratio which looks charming. The device is slim & feels premium although the back cover is made of plastic. I must tell that, nobody would regret after purchasing this one in the 10k range Indian brand.	5
Built quality of this phone is pretty good and battery doesnt drain easily; moderate usage will get you more than a day. but in terms of specs it still lacks behind many other brands like  xiomi, lenovo, honor, Asus etc at the price point. Its camera disappoints very much in low light. In fact lenovo k3 note's camera is much better than infinity display even though it came in 2015. Also Asus phones at 9000bucks launched earlier shoots much better. what is good about this phone is that  there is no heating issue.	3
After 10 days screen got damaged and now Micromax saying that this not under warranty and demanding Rs. 3850 this is very bad . So I suggest all of you do not purchase this product.	1
As per the price phone is good. What else can you expect. Phone performance is good. It's working fine. But the camera could have been better front & back both.	4
After using it heavily for 3 days.....Battery as its 2980mah is performing quite wellInfinity bezel less screen will be one of the great exp under 10kFront cam(16 mp) is better than rear cam(13 mp) *selfie loversBoth front n rear flash works wellUI could have been better but its niceFingerPrintSensor works 7to8 times in 10One of the good thing is u can use two sims and a memory card as well there is a separate slot for memory card and also battery is removable*in any emergency cndition u can take out ur batteryOverall if u see this is one of the best phn under 10k. So if ur budget is under 10 got for it.	4
Phone is very light in weight and handy. Cool in Look wise. No hang issue & rear and specially  front camera are good as expected in this mid range phone. Totally satisfied with the gaming performance of phone and with given specifications of phone. Using it for last one and half month. Under 10k price range this phone with given specifications is best to  buy for Casual use.	4
First of all its an Indian brand that's why I gave 4 star. Micromax need to improve battery and processor of Hs2 mobile. Need to improve quality. Looks are great.	4
this is a good phone. job well done micromax. i like the cover which came in the box. very nice.	4
Best budget phone in the market i suppose...,wrks great....never hangs.....battery backup is amazing.....touch is smooth .....recommended budget phone....	5
Pathetic phone! I need to return it but these Amazon people have lots of testing process. And i am not able to place a return because of these nonsense process. The phone gets heated up within some hours and battery charge drains in some mins drastically. It is pathetic. Please help return me that product.	1
Hangs when internet is switched on. selfie cam is grt. Rear camera is not so much. Could have included a better battery with much higher mAh power. Ram is not that bad, except when connected to net. Not beselless. It has bezels	2
Do not buy this phone please....horrible experience.Just a month and it started to hang.The touch did not work and applications like the camera started to operate on its own. Writing this review from their support centre in Malleshwaram,Bangalore as they refuse to replace this phone and offered to just change the touch. Who would want the camera of their phone and especially the front camera to operate on its own and whenever it wants. Please stay away from MICROMAX. I wish i could rate them zero.	1
gets slow sometimes but otherwise the piece is good.THE SCREEN IS AWESOME	4
Lovely phone with lovely features at lovely price. Love it! Excellent camera, no heating issues, good battery life and fast...	5
First hand experience is superb.Super handling n features for the range n price.WoW product from Micromax.	5
Nice phone doesn't hangFingerprint scanner is quite fastSpeed of the phone is good like a high budget smartphoneDual sim works properlyComplely satisfied with the phoneThe best you can get with this price	5
this mobile getting problem also cannot able to hear the sound and volume total very less	1
	5
Battery is a weak point, but then its decent enough for a backup of 1day. Front cam is amazing. If you are not going for Redmi, this is the best alternative for a 10k budget. I would still rate Redmi better than  Canvas infinity	4
Nice mobile	5
Remember to read all specs.It lag while playing heavy games even on the first day. But if you are not into gaming very much then it is a good option. And the 18:9 aspect ratio looks so beautiful.	3
Excellent Effort and Excellent Result by Micromax.Phone is dead gorgeous. From all sides.Beautiful and crisp displayLean form factor. Easy to handle.2.5D curved glass adds to the beautySnappy to the core. No Lag.Cameras, both back and front are good. Especially the front cam is exceptional. Images taken are crisp, detailed and accurate coloured.Just one drawback. Back camera performance under low light conditions is more desirable.I'm not comparing with any other similarly priced phone, because there is no match on many fronts. Simply don't go after spec sheet only.Best buy for the price offered.If you need a beautiful phone inside out...... just get it.Highly recommended.	5
I used this smartphone for couple of weeks and after using i am writing some details about this.----------------------------------Design and build quality-----------------------------------The 18:9 screen is good. it looks stylish while holding in hand. The back panel is removable means it do not have metal back panel. The look and feel at the back is good as compare to the budget. I feel some problem while removing its back panel. it is hard to remove the back panel. This phone has a 720p disply which is not full HD. After watching three movies on it and playing games the screen seems good. I tested the fingerprint sensor speed by observig the time it takes to unlock.------------------------------------Performance of the phone-------------------------------------It has snapdragon 425 processor with 32 GB of the storage. After playing 4-5 games I can say that process sir is ok. While playing Asphalt 8 and NOVA like games I feel that this phone struggle a little bit. The phone has Android nogut 7.1.2 which is the latest nuget version. The battery life of this phone is good but not the best. After charging it fully it gives me 9 hours of backup. It can vary according to your uses.-------------------------------camera --------------------------------The camera is not greatest. It does a decent job. I took some photographs in daylight condition from the back camera. The camera captures decent images. I also took some photographs in the low light condition or in night. In night the photos are not great. The photo come blurry a little bit. I took some selfies from the 16 megapixel front camera. The front camera captures quality images.-------------------------------Battery------------------------------The battery of the smartphone is average. It has 2900 MH battery. This battery can give you 9 to 10 hours of backup. Basically the battery backup depends on the uses. The battery backup reduces when you play high end games and watch movies.-------------------------------Ram management and storage--------------------------------It has 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. For a normal user that 32 GB storage is enough. Talking about the RAM management it has 1.5 GB of RAM free. The RAM is optimised. While multitasking it is lag free.--------------------------------Inbox content---------------------------------silicn coverscreen guardbasic cablechargerbasic earphoneuser manual	4
Camera & battery quality is bestBt phon is hang there more than 4 tym hanged in 12 daysHang tym no recive or make phone calls  then put battery open then on & make callThen best my previous phone Letv le 1s ecoIn 1 year is no hang single tym	3
excellent mobile but it better if battery is more powerful at least 4000 mAh.	5
An excellent phone. Absolutely delighted! The fingerprint functions is great and the fact that it has an additional slot for sd card is a winner feather. So you have 2 sims plus sd unlike many other phones. VoLTE too...	5
Poor battery life but excellent selfie camera( not in low light).	3
Good Phone by Micromax	5
Awesome	5

Nyyc product liked by everyone....	5
Superb phone 	5
Delay Delivery .  Phone is perfect according to price .both camera great . Only one issue i faced is that sometimes it hang for 5-6 seconds ( when i on mobile data )  otherwise phone is perfect .	4
I'm using this phone since last 25days & there is not a single problem with it	4
With the price segment of 10k micromax has done a decent job to get a better phone.Dedicated Memory ,SIM slot, Removable battery were advantageous.Screen is awesome and with HD screen battery life is very good. I don't bother a FULL HD display miss in this phone.Front facing camera is awesome.Users might face camera glitches, Install OPEN Camera app from playstore, this will solve yourr camera quality issues.Performance is better in this phone. I would suggest to keep minimal apps like stock Android version to have the best experience.Recommended phone for 10K segment buyers. All is well with Canvas Infinity.	5
Nice phone and long time battery backup camera quality nice clearly picture take	5
OK... NOT FITTED IN POCKET.. SLOW RAM	3
What's App Not Working	2
The phone is sexier to look at and performance is upto the mark... recommendable.	4
Battery is not good	3
nice product	5
Phone performance is average, phone is hanging and mis behave sometime, rear camera quality is not good.	3
I using this phone since last 2 days. It's not good time review the product but yet I am doing mean I am excited to rate this phone..Pros:=========================Display: As advertise the main feature of this phone is it's Full Vision Display 18:9 Infinity Screen. Excellent. Since now a days this feature is trending and almost other brand eg. Vivo, LG, Samsung are trying to bring this feature into their smartphone. Micromax had did well. Gaming experience is fantastic. Playing video is also a new experience. Good job in making the display. Looks a quality product.Design: is also batter, Size of the phone is same as 5" display phone. so it best fits in the pocket. weight is also not so high.Camera:Selfie camera is awesome, you can't stop your self to have selfie when you open the camera. selfie flash is available. Image quality is also good. seconder camera is average.Fingerprint sensor: Fingerprint sensor is good. you can set it to open applications you have install. apart from locking/unlocking.Non Hybrid: Best feature. Actually I'm not getting why smartphone manufacture adding hybrid slot. Is it a feature? no it's a hassle.Battery: Removable 2900 mAh. battery is bit low capacity but yet phone last long 1 day with fair use. (eg music/gaming/surfing)Other: Got in-ear Earphone and transparent back cover. (Cheap company like MI not providing)Cons:===========Only mate Black color is availableDesign is slim so may be you it fell from your handProvided Screen Guard has no use.Overall: I was looking for this kind of budgeted phone from reputed or India brand from so long. Actually it is batter than Redmi phones. you can trust Micromax at least after this piece.Strongly Recommended	5
Noice	5
Value for money..	5
Thanks.	5
Received micromax canvas infinity yesterday...the phone is getting heated up within 5 mins of use	1
Worth the money......	4
Very good phone,superb camera with 32x zooming system	5
Excilent mobile	4
Looks awesome.Performance greatCamera good.Selfie flash.	5
nice	5
Nothing like it for this range! No regret.	5
As described	3
REAL GREAT PRODUCT. Do buy and has real good camera and display	5
It's like dream come true, as this infinity is just awesome.	5
Micromax has nailed it with this phone.Looks - Phone looks great, classy black, smooth 2.5D curved glass, additional screen protector and transparent back cover is also providedDisplay - It is a gorgeous 5.7 inch display.  My phone display has a slight bluish tint and I couldn't find a way to change color calibration. Probably a software update in the future can solve  this. This Phone is increased in height, so it feels very slim and comfortable to hold.Camera - Best camera in this segment, specially the front camera. Picture quality is much better than Redmi Note 4.Performance - With SD 425 processor and android 7.1.2, it feels silky smooth for your average day work. However if you are a gamer it does lag while playing games like Subway Surfers. Don't know if it is a softaare issue or just my set has this problem.Battery - 2900 mAh battery gives you plenty of juice for a day running with average usage.Connectivity - Dual sim 4G, has a good reception, not the best, even in low signal area like inside of a building.Does not have 5GHz ac wifi capability, which is a little bummer as it is being increasingly the norm.Sound - sound output through speaker is quite loud and quality sound. So you won't miss a call. Output through headphone is also clean, much better than Redmi Note 4. You will love it.Overall, Looks is great, and adequate performance for days multitasking work, sufficient battery life, smooth near stock android Nougat experience is a plus point.	4
Mobile is very good in its price segment.	4
Very nice phone with great display. Bought it for just 9999 - 10% cash back (would come down for 9000) . My detailed review:Pro's:--Great display , it's same size of 5.5 inch phone but had 5.7 inch display.--The cheapest phone with 18:9 display till now.--Very nice UI and smooth one. Will have lot of resemblance to iOS.-- Doesn't have blotware and it pretty fast whole operating . And no heat as such for normal usage.--dedicated slot for memory card, i.e 3 slots of which 2 are for sim and 1 for memory card--removable battery, this is a good feature as if any battery issues in future can just replace it.-- front camera or selfie camera is just good--Battery performance & optimization , with just 2900 mah battery it almost coming for 1.5 to 1 day for  normal or slightly above usage respectivelyCons:--The chipset is octa core 1.4Ghz 425 Qualcomm . Could have increased the price a bit and had a better processor. Not a major con for normal use or slightly heavy use . But not a ideal one for heavy gamers and heavy users.--The one thing disappointed is the rear camera department , the photos are fine and very good in day light .  But with lot of competition from China company mobiles with dual camera setup , this is one place where micromax can improve a lot.Even if price increased by a 1000 is fine if had good dual camera with depth perception.--Battery capacity is just 2900, should have been great if had atleast 3400 or above mah . Bigger battery is always a plus with bigger screen of 5.7 inch. But can compromise on this front as not a major issue.Overall micromax had come back in style with lot of competition from China company mobiles . But if it had dual rear camera this would have been a killer phone under 10000 bucks .. the 1 star is decreased just for that	4
camera quality is not good.	1
Display is very dim.	2
Very good phone	4
Awesome but ram is less	4
I'm using Canvas Infinity from last one month and completely satisfied with it.Recently I've clicked my Rajasthan Tour with it and attached pics. For ur reference.Also Thanks Amazon team for ur superb service.Without any doubts Just Go for it.	5
Nice phones..	4
Its my 3rd phone from amazon, first one was Yureka, 2nd one - Redmi 2 prime and 3rd one - Infinity. And I move from my Samsung galaxy on8 to Micromax infinity. 2nd best phone after Yureka I'm using. But I'm little disappointed due to its 720p HD screen. And bcoz I used to Samsung amoled screen and Samsung best camera. All I can say Infinity display is Good not expected full hd with in 10k and Camera only good in beauty mode. You can see d difference btw photos as well. Speaker Sound is good not too loud like Redmi note 4 and headphone sound is awesome. Front Camera with selfie flash done its job well. Fingerprint is also working quite fast not like Sharma ji told , with in a second it will unlock your device. All in one it's a budget oriented Device. Check i took screen shot under the sun light "KBC" with 30%of screen auto brightness & 2nd photo from rear camera.	4
Best 'made in India' Mobile with extraordinary features. Awesome camera. Thank you Micromax	5
Snapdragon 425 quad core should be replaced with snapdragon 435...And in build image enhancing software is poorest...Battery does not last long..Screen is goodCamera is goodContact and call screen should be separated and various apps create their own contact list which should not be added.Brightness control does not work well.	2
One of the best full screen utility phone at this price. Not the best for games and camera is 'good' compared to premium phones, but if you are career person, you wouldn't have any complaints.	5
The display produce true colour, speaker sound is loud and clear ear phone and earphone sound is great.	5
Very slow, not good choice	1
Some times fingerprint scanner is not working..again re taking finger scan..	3
Advice: buy micromax instead of apple 8 and donate the rest of the money. Result: better phone than apple 8 and u will have all the blessings..	5
*GOOD PHONE*INBUILT CAMERA APP IS NOT GOOD (GRAINY IMAGES, NO MANUAL CONTROLS POSSIBLE) THOUGH IT HAS SOME GOOD FEATURES*CAMERA WORKING GREAT WITH 3RD PARTY APPS*LAG WHILE SWIPING FROM NOTIFICATION PANEL	4
After 10 days of usage I an writing this review:Pros:1.Good touch with better display2.Battery backup is good3.camera both front and rear good.4.No heating problem5 No lag in normal usage.I don't know abt games.Cons:1 Fingerprint recognition is working for anybody (even unregistered fingers)which is a serious glich.2.Does not accept hd videos.	2
Switching off automaticallyBad experienceFingerprint sensor is worstI think Micromax is back again.  but its back to go back	1
Better selfie camera front flash is gives very nice quality..5.7 display is awesome but not luking 5.7 .overall behtreen phone in this segment budget no one can defeat it.....	4
Good phone not excellent. Depends the price it's meet the quality.main new experience is the display.Compare to LG q6 3 times better.Good camera. Good display. Performance more than average. Battery around 8 to 9 hours (with WiFi and 4g/3g) average fingers scanner.no heating issues. Changing time also average.A full display phone with a good price and good specifications.	4
i bought for family only drawback no full hd and bad processorbeautiful phone take too long too charge but atlast micromax came up with something better	4
So far good...Nice screen display...good finger sensor...good front camera...overall for the price,a good deal...not a gaming enthusiast,so no comments on that...rest after using it for a month..	4
awesome product battery is good camera also super screen vary nice, totally very good phone	5
Too much Hanging problem after store data on internal memory, about two minutes hang, difficult to unlock and pick calls. Some times need to restart (direct battery pull)  for using handset.also refund take too long time about a month...less then one star option is not available.	1
Pros:1. Good camera and full display with nice priceCons: doesn't look like 32 gb memory phone gets stuck while net is on and sms will not show also 3gb ram looks likes only 1 gb not up to the mark recommended phone not for heavy usage only normal ones	3
Best cell phone from micromax at that price.	5
Worst phone full garbage of money..for more information contact me 6shivam98@gmail.com..onky look is good.	4
It's not good.  This may smaller than 5.7 inches	1
good	5
Don't buy any micromax product. Service is extremely bad. They have Service centers only to extort money. If you submit your device it won't come back as same. They take out perfectly working parts of your device. Micromax doesn't help in this matter at all. They all are crooks. I have been a victim of this. So I advice everyone avoid Micromax.	1
Good product	5
Sofar so good..	4
Camera Quality is not too good	4
Auto call record is not working.	2
Ultimate smartphone in low price	5
Good18:9 screen at a low priceCompactDedicated SIM and microSD card slotsBadDisplay quality is below parCustom UI is buggyPerformance is sluggish	3
Good built qualityCamera is averageNo lag while playing pubg,snyper fury etc.Speaker is averageBattery is awesome,charging time approx 40min from 30% to 100%Its worth for money just go for it.	5
The screen smashed and turned to bits! My motoG was so hardy, I'm disappointed in the quality of this phone.	1
Good and cheapRecommended for those who have a low budget and wants good features of the phone and there many good features of the phone I bought 3months back running good no complaints and I would like to try even the pro version of it. And who give 18:9 ration screen on this budget think and take it and I give it complete 5 stars because I don't have any complaints regarding this phone this is simply awesome just have to improve the quality of screen guard the company gives	5
All over the product is very good. I thanks to Micromax. Wow.	5
Perfect for price what you pay, infinity display makes big difference and processor is not bad for normal day to day task its enough.	5
I am giving this review after one month of usage.. 1st of all purely awsam display..smooth usage, .i am using near about 20 apps with hard apps, no lags. Very fast charging. In this budget i must recommend this phone. Till now nothing disappointed me.	5
I didn't believe in Micromax quality until I used this phone. It's the best Infinity Display phone for a cheaper rice..it's equally lasts with Nokia 5 and 6 in terms of quality	5
Bugs, automatically camera and other app on when mobile unlock. No updates available, accepted camera display quality not good	1
Why not gold or rose gold or any other colour is available other than the black one? Other then a good device in this price range among the best..	5
Slow processor, lags while switching screens even when no apps are open	2
It goes without saying that the gap between phones is getting smaller and smaller. Years ago, phones would either dominate the market, or just simply be forever in the "cheap and acceptable" area for performance and quality etc.Speed and performance:I have to be honest, the performance on this handset is flawless. It is super quick, responsive and hasn't yet lagged at all or dipped in performance in the slightest. I can open the camera quickly (something that other phones struggle with if you're coming from an app), can take a photo and then go back to the app that I was in without any issues at all.Battery:This is my only negative. I have this phone meaning I have the 2900mAh battery within the handset. I am pretty heavy on my phone, and forever checking emails and texting my girlfriend (gotta make her feel loved like haha) so always using it. After starting work at around 9am and finishing at 5, I am usually down to around 20%. I don't find that things such as the camera have such a hard effect on the battery, unless you're filming in, then you start to notice a metaphorical leak so to speak.Screen:My goodness... this is my favorite part. I always thought this bezeless, or at least small bezel thing was a bit of a gimmick, but oh no. I could never go back to a phone that doesn't have this kind of display ever again. This handset, is smaller than other smart phones, but has a bigger screen. Weird, huh? Well, because the screen practically covers the entire phone size, you get a beautiful view and great clarity that is simply gorgeous. Honestly though, the screen is beautiful, I am being very serious when I say that this is the most beautiful screen I have seen on a phone before, and it has completely changed my opinion on how phones should be designed from now on.Camera:The camera is good. It offers good colour reproduction and produces sharp images. I find the video modes are good, and there are modes such as Super pixel Modes meaning you can take control of various controls on your camera. It's a shame that there isn't a dual camera setup, considering that a lot of phones are going that way, but let's be honest, if you're truly wanting to get into photography, then you're going to get yourself a DSLR. This phones camera performs excellently taking nice images and will suit the needs of the majority if not all of the people that use it. Video low light performance is a little bit average, but in well lit environments the colours are beautiful and are exceptionally well complemented by the gorgeous display.Overall:Look, this handset in my opinion is fantastic. But I genuinely think this is a change. The handset offers a beautiful, and I really do mean a beautiful design and great performance meeting many criteria and expectations. I love this phone. Honestly. I am usually so critical of phones and find it hard to settle with one, but so far, this handset is proving to be the best phone. I would definitely recommend.	5
An all-rounder with best in class battery life.Key Highlights:Class leading battery life, ergonomic design and compact form factor, excellent price to performance ratio, best selfie camera performance in low-light situations.Verdict:The Micromax Canvas Infinity is the best smartphone to buy under 10,000. this phone's battery life is the best thing about it. TheMicromax Canvas Infinity can easily last a full day for even the most heavy-duty user, while regular and light users can expect anything over a day and a half, or more. The camera is acceptable for this price range, while the performance is best in class as well.The Experience:The Micromax Canvas Infinity proved to be quite an ideal smartphone for anyone looking for a compact smartphone that is affordable but doesn't cut corners in a big way. Right from performance on browsing, social media apps to gaming, the phone never felt slow or out of breath. The battery performance really stands out, with almost 2 days of battery life for moderate users, you really can't ask for more from a smartphone in this price range. The device feels well made in terms of build quality and finish and it easy to use and manage. i recommend the 3GB RAM + 32GB storage (infinity) version, as it has that extra head-room for more apps and smoother multitasking. The camera is perhaps the only area where we expected more from micromax. It clicks good pictures in daylight but isn't able to hold-on to the picture quality in low-light. But then, you can't have it all!	5
Great display quality but performance is medium.	4
I purchased it for myself,really it's worth the money .phone looks very premium	5
Gifted to me bro. It's been 3 months since I bought. Running smooth. Worth for the price 10k.	4

Perfect phone for everyoneBest in all aspects	5
Good mobile but it hangs some time	4
I didn't purchased this phone but I recieved it as a gift from my brother. As he know I was a big fan of Micromax. So he attempted this to make me suprise. After receiving this product I was really amazed that Micromax can still compete with the current giants. Now explaining it's features.1. First one to go with infinite display in India.2. Exceptional front camera.3. Ok ok back camera.4. First phone with Snapdragon from Micromax.5. Performance good.6. Storage and RAM also good.7. User interface is also awesome.8. Battery is sufficient if fast charging was added.9. Expandable memory nice work.10. Removable battery don't know why and no hot plug support.Overall at this price point with infinite display and very good front camera, best possible built quality no log in performance. I just love this phone .Thank You Micromax. GooD JoB	4
Pros of Micromax Infinity:Good looking 18:9 ratio dispaly (rounded borders)Decent Performance16MP front camera24 hours Service or ReplacementCons of Micromax Infinity:Mediocore Display ResolutionRear camera is averageBuild quality is average	4
I am writing this review after 6 months from the Purchase date.Coming from the windows phone background and since it is my first Android device :This is a fabulous device but I was a bit sceptical in the beginning whether or not should I buy it. Trust me guys this device met all the Expectations. It is obviously not a high end device but yes it did all the multitasking that I was looking for. There are usually 526 applications which are always open the background which includes WhatsApp, my email client, My Airtel App, Facebook app etc. But despite of running multiple applications this phone neither overheats no shows any sort of hanging issues.The Battery life  - the battery life is simply amazing. Uses phone bit more than average user as I'm into the client servicing profile so this phone is basically a good side kick. After full day use this phone still leaves me with 30% off battery life. For example if I charge my phone at 9 in the morning to hundred percent then this phone leaves me with 30% battery life at 9 at night which is not bad when u  talk about the battery life.The design and make of this phone is quite sleek gives a quiet premium feel when you hold in your hand. The phone is a metal body back cover which is quite durable as well. I have dropped this phone quite many times from my hand and even sometimes while it was in the charging mode, trust me there were no signs of any screen breaking or any dent in the metal body.I must tell you guys that I am not using any tempered glass for my phone, but still my phone screen sustained those drops and showed no cracks or signs. I'm just using the rubber casing, and a screen protector which came along with the phone.The cameras are  fabulous. I would say they are  doing the wonders in the low light but yes overall I would give it 8.5 out of 10.(Both front and back).Overall verdict is that this phone is rubbing shoulders with some of the high and phones in the market.I am planning to gift a new Micromax infinity phone to my wife on our anniversary.	5
I like to buy this phone because Micromax is give 1phone in best price best features ke sath so I am buy or don't buy LG q6 because q6 does not have fingerprint sensor and costly but this phone is all features and low price	5
I got this mobile 10 days before and very much satisfied till now.Front camera quality is very good and rear camera also good.Finger senser is very fast and mobile unlocked in super fast speed.Battery lasts one day and its OK.Mobile is very slim and it is not bulky like other 5.7 inch screen phone.	5
Agar micromax ne ye fone me full hd display diya hota & rear camera zyada acchee dee hoti & processor bhi better diya hota...Sabse main issue ye fone kee battery hai...bahut kum hai......Agar ye sab cheezen micromax solve karde to fir ye fone ko log 15,000 me bhi khareed lenge	5
Excellent performance of the phone will be more than happy to buy one more time . excellent camera phone value for money	5
There are issues in the phone. User experience is very poor. if more that 2 apps are already open... Yahoo mail app do not open!! System update is not downloading at all for file size of 95.x mb. Help center asked to do factory reset!! This is just third month of usage. No games No Video streaming  a very conservative use and this is the state of the phone!!! So please do read more reviews before thinking of waste of investment of Rs. 9999/- to be precise!!	2
Best smartphone , clear camera better battery backup,faster performance and good looking, made in India	5
Don't buy	1
Awesome phone do go for it INDIAN BRAND..	5
Good phone but not soo good...battery, charging port, ram management, performance are all average not soo good u can judge urself wen compared to other phones in this price range	3
Priced at Rs. 9,999, the Micromax Canvas Infinity tries to bring an 18:9 display to the budget market. While we have to commend Micromax for trying, this phone definitely falls short in many areas. Despite the display being this phone's highlight, it is also its biggest disappointment. The My Launcher skin is buggy and performance is sluggish. If you're in the market for a sub-Rs. 10,000 Android smartphone, you should look at other options such as the Xiaomi Redmi 4 , Moto G5 , Nokia 5, or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 , all of which have better hardware at around the same price. If you still want a smartphone with 18:9 display just because it's something new, then you should save up some money and go for the LG Q6  instead.	4
First I gave to congratulate Micromax for their good effort. Now let's come to the point --1. It's made in China, not our country India. Micromax being Indian co., the handset should be manufactured in our country.2. Look of the handset is quite different from the online advertisement photos. I think it is not bezelless phone.3. You are giving 5.7" screen, then it should be full HD. There is no meaning of 1440720 pixels.4. Now a days, battery should be at least @ 4000 mah.Thanks for reading my points. If you agree than pls. like it.	4
Don't buy from micromax worst build quality and the phone will have a lot of problems and will become unusable after a few months.	1
Initially i gave 5 stars and trusted this brand. It was very tight to plug in and out of the charger. Neglected and continued to use as I thought it might be a new phone and gradually it will be ok to use  But now frequently I find charging issue with this phone. Now not at all charging in two months. the phone is otherwise good model slender and sleek desgn, software updates often given - install or ignore it. These software updates didnt help out my charging problem so it is hardware issue. don't know how much time  the chennai  service centre would take. Have sent mail to info@micromaxinfo.com.will update the consequences later.	2
Don't go for this. Completly trap. No accesories available in online and out side too. Camera 3. Display 3 . Battery 3.5. softwares 2.5	1
Here is a detailed review of Micromax Infinity to help you make your purchase. Do leave a helpful vote :)Reasons to Buy Micromax Canvas Infinity (Pros and Advantages):1. The first reason to go with it is for the noticeably massive 5.7 inch screen. This is not the first time the company has designed a huge display device. The resolution is a bit odd for it is of 7201440 pixels which holds a pixel density of 279 ppi (pixels per inch). I wish the resolution is full HD as it will have better pixel density and clarity. Anyway the aspect ratio is 18:9 which translates to 2:1 and I would say its very tall, kind of reminds me the Galaxy S8. The brightness level seems decent with good amount of saturation and contrast levels.2. Next is that under the hood it comes with Snapdragon 425 chipset which has a 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU. Its a quad-core CPU which has the ability to process any apps without any issues. However I wish it to be an octa-core CPU but for that it will have to come with Snapdragon 625 which will eventually increase its price. You will not face any heating problems or lagging issues even multitasking continuously for longer time. Right now it is a strong competitor to the Motorola Moto E4 Plus.3. The primary memory is of 3 GB which have around 1.6 GB left after initial boot.4. The secondary memory is of 32 GB. It has about 26.2 GB left for the user. There is a memory card slot which can read up to a maximum of 128 GB. And yes it is a dedicated slot with no strings attached.5. For gaming it comes with the Adreno 508 GPU. It can run any graphic intensive apps without any kind of frame drops or lags.6. Another Micromax Canvas Infinity pros is the operating system. Out of the box it runs on Android Nougat version 7.1.2 which is the latest one. Plus the company has also specifically mentioned that it will receive future operating system upgrade to Android Oreo. Thats a huge bonus.7. The camera on the rear comes with a 13 megapixel sensor. The focal aperture is f/2.0 and it can record videos up to a maximum resolution of 1080p at 30 fps (frames per second). Secondary optics is powered by a 16 megapixel sensor which has the same focal aperture as that of the rear camera. The front camera can also record videos in full HD resolution. On both the sides there is an LED flash to deal with low light conditions. Micromax has always been in the decent zone if you ask about the camera quality. The colors, saturation, contrast and brightness are pretty decent.8. On the rear there is a fingerprint scanner which resides just below the camera. The maximum number of fingers it can register is five. It is very sensitive and also quite accurate in recognizing. Takes less than 0.3 seconds to unlock the smartphone.9. Another advantages of Micromax Canvas Infinity is that it supports USB OTG cable. You can connect flash drives and transfer files to and fro.Reasons Not to Buy Micromax Canvas Infinity (Cons, Demerits, Downsides, Disadvantages, Issues and Problems):1. The first problem or cons of Micromax Canvas Infinity is with the battery capacity. For a massive display of 5.7 inches the 2980 mAh battery is really low. I could stand if it is a Samsung or Motorola device, they have better power management algorithms as they tweaks the operating system for better performance. Also there is no fast charging feature. For a normal user its OK not to have quick charge but for avid users it is a must.2. Second disadvantages is the absence of a reputed display protection. It has neither Corning Gorilla Glass, not Asahi Dragontrail Glass. When it will break it will be shattered completely, thats the problem with standard glass protector for the display.3. Another demerits or issues is the absence of compass. How on earth they ignored the compass for the 10,000 price smartphone. Its a must otherwise turn-by-turn navigation with maps is not possible.4. And the last cons of Micromax Canvas Infinity is that it does not have the gyroscope sensor. It is important for connecting VR headsets, running augment reality applications, etc.My Verdict: If you can compromise the cons then its good to go.However, if you can increase your budget I would suggest Redmi 4A.	4
Average quality... Plz dnt buy. Camera is good. Jio sim dnt work properly.. Disply brightness is not good... Wast of money only..	5
Thumps Up for this awesome phone!	5
Great try and failed miserably.Bought this cause of its main attraction "the 18:9 display" . Except that everything is a disaster.Built and body:It's good and looks premium. Having 2.5D curved glass and no Gorilla glass leaves a worry each time I drop the phone.Software:Though the hardware specs looks decent the software UI is sluggish and hopeless. The default launcher is miserable with low amount of customisation options but also hangs whenever other launcher's are used. The surprising thing is SYSTEM UI STOPS SOMETIMES!!! Being a beta user for few apps is a pain in the neck. Almost every alternate update of any app makes the crash and make you vulnerable waiting for another update.The insane thing is Micromax diagnostics checks for crashes and already I have submitted several feedback messages but nothing seems to work (**they don't seem to care**). No OTA updates so far. (*By December 2017*)Camera:Low light camera fails in both rear and front camera. Don't consider the flash in front camera cause it's intensity is so low. No slow motion option. No EIS nor OIS. Super pixel works fine sometimes. Surprisingly front video has a lot better stabilization than back. Both front and back support 1080p videos also lot of noise alike. Daylight photography is fine. Focus on sharp detail is merely impossible how hard you try. Portrait and face beauty are clearly a diversion cause they both fail incredibly.So buy at your own risk.Buying this believing it for an genuine Indian product fooled me good.	1

The phone at first look is an ice breaker at this price ...during the first year everything related to it I'm pressed me weather it is sound quality or features.....but as the first year ended the story took a horrible turn. My phone has now a lot of issues , it's charging speed has slowed down, it didn't charge at once,I have to reinsert the charging pin while charging as it stops charging after some times, it comes out of sleep after pressing the side button a lot of times,and even when I press the side key to lock it ,it makes an emergency number call automatically......etc....etc....And now it has revealed it's face after 1yr so I can't avail for warranty replacement.	2

Battery backup is okay, picture quality is bright, and sound quality is moderate. Functions are a bit copy of iPhone X which is unique as compared to other nougat devices. Processor is not too good as phone gets heated up due to continuous use.Screen has no protection glass so once it drops out of hand then in contact with floor or smashing slightly will lead to screen breakage which cannot be replaced.	3
Pros:Good camera quality, battery almost lasts for a day, good display, fingerprint sensor works fine.Cons:Microphone is very poor, it hangs sometimes while multitasking, poor processor.This device is a pure copy of Wiko view.	3

Awesome phone . Buy it guys .	5
Update after 6 months: This phone is a real value for money. I have bought a Sony Xperia xz premium and one Redmi note 5 pro for cousine. When you play YouTube hd videos simultaneously, you realise the diff is negligible. Sony I paid 55k. Photos of Redmi note 5 pro and canvas infinity are comparable(cannot compare the qualities with Sony Xperia xz premium). Audio with the stock headphones also good. No hanging issue so far. Heat is just like any other phone only. Battery is good one day even after switching on the hotspot for many hours. I am not a gamer so that part no idea, bit temple run is running flawlessly. One thing still don't know when they are releasing Oreo as thy declared during the time of launch. Overall very much satisfied what I have paid.Four days of use. Battery lasts only 8 hr medium use with Jio sim and another sim in the slot. Not much app installed. Don't know whether UC browser eats up more battery. I have stopped the notorious Micromax "App Center" notification by denying notification permission. Camera display etc are very good if you are considering the amount you have spend. Though screen display quality is not a crystal clear one but it is color rich. It would have been better if it had better sharpness. Music quality is not  good but call quality is good. So far I am satisfied with purchase for rs 8499	4
Not buying this phone..	1
Nice phone superb camera good processor excellent battery backup front camera is great with selfie flash look is also good back camera has a fair job overall a perfect phone for anyone, but strictly not for gamers,, best camera feature is it has front potrait mode. It's a good starter for anyoneq,This review is updated after a year on 18th October 2018It's still working well no problemAnd you can enjoy face unlock in this phone just follow these steps1.go to Settings2.choose key gaurd and password3.go to smart lock4.accept conditions5.choose trusted faceIt's your face unlock	5
Camera zoom not available	1
The Phone is superb & packed with features, The battery is fine,  the removable battery is an advantage  and i am sure the battery will be available freely, the Screen is superb edge to edge resolution  and can be viewed up to 30degrees flawlessly.In the price the phone is sold, it is the Best deal ,  even the best phones these days need to be charged daily to add that 25/50% juice to complete the full charge, Infinity is the right name for this phone  it has it all. pictures are superb and has many options. the transparent back flexible case supplied is a nice protection for camera lens and screen, the sound is clear  for every bit of music (for videos)  Music playback sound depends on the original source, there is a lightsensor activated screen, a three finger pull to save screen short, lifes' going to be a lot easier for a lot of people with this economical and one of the best phones launched by micromax  I have clicked indoor pictures and closeup  but the result will be still better because i have not peeled off the thin plastic on the lens 9 I will do it when I have a proper safety cover, as the lens is slightly above the body, picture 1 and 2 are front camera.  will upload outdoor pictures later...Today as on 29th October 2018  the phone is still going strong i have included a 64 gd memory card.wonder whether its still available	5
Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone	5
Got delivered in just 2.5 hours of my order. No bad overservations yet. Fingerprint unlock is also good, if you have face unlock ON then all the time it will unlock with face data before the the fingerprint works.	5
As the slogan says never settle....proper flagship killer	5
One word Amazing phone	5
Great for all specs except for the battery life. Battery drains faster than expected. Without that totally worth it...	5
First and foremost...I really dont miss those 3.5 mm jack. Using bluetooth earpiece and the sound quality is top notch.Picture quality - initial shots taken are impressive.Battery life is best among all one plus phones.Build quality is superb. No issues with call clarity and now the best part...Oxygen OS. Its buttery smooth, fluidic and unputdownable. You will ne addicted to it.Only con is the weight of the device.	5
I like this product very much	5
Best pH ever..	5
Very nice and fantastic phn, the best smart phn till date, awesome camera good battery life	5
Well, as they claim, it is a flagship killer.Superfast charging, barely takes and hour to charge almost full. Speaker is loud enough.Worth the money. OnePlus also proved their worth over the years by providing timely android updates for a long time. So this phone can be used for atleast 5 years without any worries.Totally loved it.Got it delivered in less than 12 hours, all credit goes to Amazon.in for that.	5
Picture quality is good sound is also good but battery life is good if u don't play games.	5
Super nice	5
Just awesome	5
I like its full display and picture quality is good but temperd glass should be given to all customers	4
Best phone i ever had	5
This mobile is the best I have ever seen before... Picture quality and speed are awesome.. Sound is bit louder. Battery is the main perspective for me and it fulfilled that with great battery life.... Gaming experience is super graphics are awesome and not hanging even if it's a full graphical game. Camera is good. Overall it's the best.	5
Simply I love it..	5
Super	5
Issue with the Camera Slow Motion Mode is Not Working in Home Black Shade is Moving from left to right Sound Quality is not that good	5
Good	4
The OnePlus 6T is a truly great phone no matter what the price, but at half the cost of an iPhone XS with a cutting-edge in display fingerprint sensor this is the bargain buy of the year. Everybody is complaing about in-display fingerprint scanner is slow but trust me its very very very fast, phone gets unlocked as soon as your finger touches the screen and more accurate than other phones, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that cutting-edge technology doesnt have to cost the Earth, bringing an in-display fingerprint scanner and a tiny notch for just 37K. The gorgeous, crisp and colourful OLED display is a smidgen bigger at 6.41in, with a smaller chin at the bottom is simply amazing, coming to camera the new nightscape low light mode does a good job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is also pretty good Portrait mode works as advertised, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is good and when you use the fingerprint sensor the night mode for the display is disabled temporarily and then fades back in once youve unlocked the phone. The phone comes with a screen protector already on it. the single bottom-firing speaker is loud and has a relatively large amount of bass for the phone, but is easily blocked while playing a game. OnePluss alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and is still brilliant. OnePlus phones have always been good for the money, offering top specifications in well-built devices, but not pushing the boundaries of whats possible. Thats changed for the OnePlus 6T. It is pushing whats possible with the popular all-screen design using a tiny, attractive teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and its a better phone for it. But it is the introduction of a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, and making it work really well for as little as half the price of an iPhone XS, that is most impressive. theres no wireless charging, it doesnt have any of the fancy 3D face systems of some and it looks a little plain, but everything else is top notch. Even the software experience is excellent.Pros:- Good battery life, great screen, excellent performance, dual-sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5, great software, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, affordable price relative to premium phones, last but not least Blazing fast softwareCons:- No notification light, glass back but no wireless charging, no expandable storage.Overall phone is excellent and it really delivers it's tagline Never Settle.Being a Amazon Prime Member Still Delivery Was Slow And Packing Is Very Poor.....	5
Dis is classic phone. All time. Best in class.	5
For the cost , this is one value for money product. It is feature rich and perfect for a person like me. Am an avid foodie and traveller. This is a perfect phone to capture what I want whenever I want . And with amazing clarity. Also amazing speed . I became a fan with OnePlus 3 and this one has be convinced that this is one of the best smart phone options out there.	5
Awesome love it 	5
Amazing Phone	5
Just superb	4
Crisp picture quality, impactful sound and an impressive battery life makes it a worthy investment. A blind buy for those who plan to upgrade to OnePlus from others...Fingerprint sensor, face unlock are exciting features but not indispensible.All in all its a fair deal if the base variant itself is 128gb!! What more can u ask for!!I'm happy...N yes...Thank you Amazon for the On time delivery..	5
Picture quality,sound and battery life is awesome	5
Totally loving the device, camera works beautifully with low light also, take awesome pictures. Selfie also come clean and sharp. 6gb ram can run two demanding games simultaneously in split screen without any lag. Apps looks nice on bigger screen, even videos looks great with sharp viewing angles and bright colors.Dash charge, charges very fast keeping the battery long enough for 8-9 hours for heavy users.In display fingerprint works like charm with beautiful animation but doesn't seem to be faster than previous type of scanner. Though face unlock is more faster than all.Only downside is from software side, oxygen os is very fluid and smooth, 1)android pie has its issues, adaptive brightness automatically shift itself to lowest light every time screen goes off. So need update on that side.People were complaint so much about 3.5 jack but i think very much manageable with the adapter provided	5
The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.Cons :Concern is the notification led light. we are not sure whether battery is 100% while charging. Single touch display to see notification is beautiful.One plus should have added the charge + 3.5 jack in type c converter. which would be added value for those who watch movie or listen song while charging.	5
Pros: Glamorous looks, great free case, free screen guard, camera like SLR, super fast, face detection is lightening fast.Cons:  On screen sensor not super quick if not properly setup. If you setup properly, it's good.	5
Picture quality superbActually OnePlus 3t 5 5t 6 in my family finally I got OnePlus 6tSound quality superbBattery backup also fineThere is no need to woory about battery backup because dash charging is hereProcessing speed also superbAnd upto now there is no minus I saw still 10days	5
Picture quality is not up to the mark, it's not as per the description given. Need to work hard on the same. Pic gets blurred when we zoom the camera. It states 20mp camera, but I don't think so that actually is.	3
Good phone working very fast and night mood is awesome look is very good	5
Well one plus 6T is awesome. It's truly a flagship killer. Camera cud have been a bit better but hey it's ok nothing can be too perfect right	5

Awesome mob...I loved it	5
Mobile is superb no doubt but it must be approx 23-25 k because some other mobiles are giving same features at less in price..	4
Excellent phone, with great specification	5
Best in class, camera is awesome. And while playing pubg there was zero lag and the graphics at it's highest still didn't heat up the device. But battery management is weak, 4hrs of regular usage got me 34% from full charge.	5
The bottom front part could have so much more screen like the iPhone X , otherwise it`s a cool phone to have hands on.	5
Best Android phone till date. I have been using it for 3 days now and OnePlus didn't let me down.* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.This is the best phone you can buy in 2018 and early 2019 at around 35-40k. So go ahead and buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it!	5
Provide head set and gorilla glass with the hand set.	5
Super package	5

AS I HAD ALREADY CUSTOMER OF ONE PLUS 5,IAM VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WITH PACKING MATERIAL OF ONE PLUS 6T, I COMPARE BOTH BOXES OF ONE PLUS 5 AND 6TWHEN I PICK MY NEW PHONE 6T,I FOUND MATERIAL USED IS VERY DULL,MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS 0BUT OVERALL PHONE IS WORKING WELL WITH LESS BATTERY BACKUP	5
Battery life is better. Picture quality is good. Sound quality is also reasonably good but definitely not the best among its competitors. Having said that, this phone is really really fast. Display is awesome. Dash charger is wow as usual.	5
Amazing phone, just feels good.Done the ma+h, price isn't everything.You get what you pay for. :)Excellent battery,Great screen,Amazing performance,Smoooth OS,Great camera,Surprisingly decent audio,Cool screen unlock and ridiculously fast face unlock.The phone is worth every penny spent.	5
First offall thanks to One Plus company to making such a nice phone... Very comfortable for using,,, camera quality is awesome... Sound quality is OK.... Battery life is great .. But It's little bit heavy... That's OK will adjust... Totally amazing phone... Thanks Amazon... For one day delivery..	5
I waited for a long time for the Oneplus 6T model launch. I purchased it with lots of expectations and I am happy that it met my most of the expectations. I purchased Oneplus 6T 128gb and 6gb RAM version mirror black phone.Pros :-1) Super fast processor- can play large games without any glitch.2) Camera is super amazing. However in the night mode, the pictures are sometimes hazy. Overall it is good.3) The phone is damn beautiful. The back of the phone is simply outstanding. Notch also looks cute.4) Fingerprint sensor is working fine.5) Sound quality is good. The speakers are loud and  bass is also good. However, the company should have launched it with dual speakers. It would have been phenomenal.6) The company has increased the battery size. It gives a backup of atleast 1.5 days with normal usage.Cons:-1) NO HEADPHONE JACK. The company was making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack, but they did the same. I just have a doubt that how will I charge my phone and watch a movie via earphones at the same time. I have to buy an external adapter which will put a dent on my pocket again.2) If I am holding my phone and have put my thumb impression as my Fingerprint phone unlock option. Then sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone. Coz while holding the phone I have to put my thumb straight which is quite difficult.3) The night mode of the camera needs improvement.4) No dual speaker.Conclusion:It is a nice phone with brilliant specifications. It easily beats some of the high end phones of Apple , Samsung and LG and others. So you may go for it.	4
Good phone but not best.... but delivery was superfast, order in morning 9 am and delivery in evening 7pm	5
I have purchased this phone and trusted amazon for over 2 years but now i am feeling stunned with the product quality.This phone gets switch off sometimes and getting ON only by hard rebooting but when i tried to return it , first a 3rd party app told me that your phone is all right. So if this kind of service is provided by amazon then i am not gonna do any kind of purchase from amazon.This is very bad.Worst service by amazon	1
BUSINESS	5
1. Its adapter is heating as hell.2. After repeatedly updating also it appears as if something is pending to update but still not updating and sticking to notification pannel(i shared the pic of the same).3. Battery draining too quickly.4. Camera quality is ok only.	3
Great phone. Fastest phone in the world. Also great features looks style display n overall performance	5
Very beutiful device i got with cheapest price...!!!	5
Awesome performance 	5
Superb low light picture ...nd looks of D's mobile just awesome	5
No issues...	5
As always one plus at its best. Except the ever increasing price, all is good. It's now in LG g7 price territory.	5
The oneplus 6t is very good but the unboxing for the late bookers a 3 translucent coloured case should have been provide , howere the head phones are not available but atleast 3 cases should have been provide very disappointed one plus for thisThe phone is very fast an it's amazing	4
Super fast Super cool phone. In display fingerprint scanner is so futuristic. Its time to embrace technology - time to use Bluetooth headphones & goodbye 3.5mm jack.	5
Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.	2
-2nd day delivery-Best smartphone for the price offered-Battery life is awesome... two days with normal usage without any heavy downloads-Charging speed is awesome... 0-90% in 1 hour-Blazing speed for games (PUBG)-Feel night camera option is not good-Overall happy with the product	5
Excellent product. Fast delivery service.	5
Camera work comparatively compromising with iphones else best flagship phone yet	4
Best phone for 38k , it's  worth every penny .	5
Worst camera quality gives colour issues	1
Lots of issues including hanging and fingure lock accessibility.	2
Camera is awesome and the battery life is good	5
Best phone !!!In love with the fingerprint scanner and it's animation !Battery lasts one day !Industry leading camera with studio mode works fantastic !Catchy display !Fast like a flash !Great Value for money !!!!!	5
Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is  absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered.	5
Best Phone	5
Nothing to deslike	5
Nice phone	5
The display is simply superb. Hats off to video stabilization.	5
Amazing phone 	5
Excellent	5
Only name very bad quality	1
Finally I moved from iOS to android and oneplus was my first choice .amazon did a fast delivery.Well I will start with what I feel I didnt like ....1) speaker is not good ....from iPhone coming to oneplus flagship u need much more better speakerOther than this I am happy with the phone till now as this is my second day of useMany feel headphone jack abscence is bad well, for me I hardely use them so ok for me . Battery well if you use a week internet then it will drain fast ...at higher speed I saw it was working great 20 minutes of YouTube and 15 minutes of gaming it just dropped 7% . So its okComing to notification light ...it does pops up the notification u need to activate them .Finger print lock ...well if you lift ur finger too fast it wont detect ...otherwise its fast , face unlock is very fast ....face unlock in dark will also work but u need to activate those from settings ....for those who have doubt go to YouTube and see tips for oneplus 6t .a video in 2 parts are there it will help you in all the settingsThere is also option for hidden apps which is great featureCamera is good ,Big phone as I just ditched iPhone 6 so getting adjusted to it .So all over its a great phone , if anyone have any question u can ask me here I will respondThank you	5
Its amazing phone ....that's why it comes in best premium category cell phone in India 2018....10 on 10 ....and thanks for Amazon for prompt and unexpected delivery.....	5
It's just incredible one of the best phone	5
I cant download app in Google play store.	1
Unbelievable phone 	5
Superb phone	5
No words	5
Performance Was Excellent	5
Excellent built quality...better body to screen ratio, excellent nightscape photos	5
Everything is suddenly sooooo fast..	5
This phone is superb. The bottom firing speakers are a bit soft to my liking but it's pretty decent. I'd suggest you guys go for the 8GB model as the phone was using 3.1 GB ram right out of the box but overall, an excellent phone. You can't go wrong with this. ;)	5
Here is my reviews for this deviceDisplay 5/5Sound 4/5Camera 4/5Battery 5/5Woukd like to tell that camera quality and configuration are as same as oneplus6,	5
Picture quality is awesome!!!!	5
Amazing phone... Superb picture quality......	5
Absolutely amazing phone!!!	5
Hats off to OnePlus..no words for this peice of work.. I'm thankful to OnePlus for providing me such a machine made with such an effort 	5
Picture quality is average..Sound quality is not up with compatetors..Price is very high compare to compatetor......Not much as expected boom..Fast charging is super.....	3
Super Fast Speed Camera Quality very Good And And capturing Pictures in night awesome battery backup is good And fast ChargingThere are No Audio Jack  Additional audio Connector	5
Overall phone is too Good, I love it	5
This is the best phone which I ever bought . Picture quality is the best. Everything is best . I recommend this phone	5
looks premium in hand	5
I'm in love with everything that this phone provided but I'm not able to digest the missing of headphone jackThe performance is spectacular. The fastest phone on Android side of things at least.Camera is damn good and that night mode though Battery life is also extraordinary. I'm getting about 8 hours sit and with gaming like pubg 6-7 hoursScreen! Man this looks gorgeousBuilt quality is also perfect what you expect from oneplusUi is one of the best I've usedTotally one of the best phone you can buy at around 35-40k	5
Good	3
It's Really good phone to daily routine people's ...Easy & Quick Charge in this phone	5
Camera is pathetic. Takes blurry pics sometimes. Pics gets detoriarated on little bit of zooming also. Looks like its a 8mp camera. Samsung takes better pics even in 8k phone. Low light is equally bad. Poor selfie camera. Those saying awesome camera have no idea about cameras. Improve camera performance in the next update.Its blazzing fast. Smooth. Looks great. But cam and speakers r disappointment.	2
Awesome phone	5
Pages/writings/app-view gets cut in the bottom left or right corners due to the curves. A software improvement is needed for this.	4
Where when and how can we get the type c headphones for the pre booking offer that was mentioned ?	5
Everything is good but the camera's picture quality is worst....it's disappointing factor for me even my iPhone 6 clicks good photos some times to compare OP6T. Sometimes auto focus is not working as well as picture quality is not good if you clicked 4-5 pics, 2-3 pics are out of focus and in night photography there are too much noise.And second problem is some times in display fingerprint not works well....taking too much time to recognize.-Battery backup is good (It's enough for whole 1 day if you charged once in the morning....Full charging gets approx 1.5 hr time)-Sound quality is average. Noisy speaker feels like a cheap. Some times I missed 3.5 jack.-Premium looks and display quality are awesome.-Speed and performance are fantastic.-And last It's Feels heavy.-Otherwise all things good.I got 3k discount on this phone when ordered on 1st nov (2k in ICICI bank debit card + 1k cashback on amazon pay) & also got 2K discount because of RS. 1500 earphone + 500 cashback early booking offer. So, overall I paid 33k for 6gb ram +128gb storage on 6T.	4
It's awesome phone with dual camera . Picture quality is super	5
Loving it	5
Worth the wait	5
One plus 6t is the  Best Smart PhoneOxgen Os over Android Pie & SD 845  gives the Smooth User Friendly Experience.Graphic Intensive Games like Pubg Mobile Works Extra Smooth .Camera it is the best One i have ever used.The New NightScape  Feature works pretty Fine.Pictures that i have taken with  My Oneplus 6t isPosted BelowGreat battery life - Screen On time of Minimum 7 hrs.. and maximum of 9 hrs.Premium Design.Over all i would recommend oneplus over other smartphones ...i love this phone	5
Amazing product	5
Zakas	5
Incredible phone..marvellous design, super speed, amazing features, fingerprint recognition super fast.	5
Superb phone amazing specs, hardware, display is damn good, build quality is awesome	5
After opening the package. The headphone accessories was missing.	5
Good phone but apart from in screen finger print sensor and longer battery life not a lot has changed compared to oneplus 6. I do miss the notification LED in this oneplus 6t phone!	4
Truly the best phone	5
value for money	5
Great	5
Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor. It is very sensible I must say unlike the back one. I need to put my finger in proper way otherwise I won't be able to unlock my phone.	4
Superb cameraSuperb picture quality	5
In love with this phone, in-display fingerprint sensor works absolutely brilliant.	5
Good sound quality, good battery life	5
No doubt this device is blazing fast. Great work from oneplus team. Battery life is just amazing.In display fingerprint, whenever you'll use you will realize that it's the fastest. Camera section improved and it really works well. Worth it.Display as you know super amoled, very smooth & delicate touch. Super bright.The best you get is lag free device and i m loving this.Must buy and if u already own op6 than wait for op7.	5
Battery life is very disappointing even it is increased  by 400mah.Other features are good. Built quality is good.Product delivery is great.Night mode camera quality is average.Last but the least heating issue is also that cannot be ignored. We are facing little bit to moderate heating back panel on even normal usage.	3
Bestest phone in Best Price!	5
Best phone ever used in all manner.only the price should be within 30-34 k.Camera is very nice.I love the oxygen is and it's features ,It is near stock Android.Thanks Android update pie..I think it is the first phone non Google which has Android pie out of box.Lastly best flagship phone in all respect and in all departments.	5
Mobile is too good , but product i received faulty , on 2 nd day I connected to charging by keeping g switch off and change sim card . it cant switched on .  I placed immediately replacement order and Amazon take it properly. Thanks Amazon. But now I cancelled and all order.	3
Nice oneplus	5
This is my first experience with one plus. Good camera, better performance, good screen quality but phone little bit heavy. Go for it.	5
Fingerprint sensor is a bit lagging very minute when compared to the other siblings of Oneplus,other than the onscreen fingerprint everything is really fabulous. Even the fingerprint is awesome but you can sense the lag a bit.(+)	5
Absolutely loved the phone.Got it delivered within two days without prime.Amazing camera. So Seamless experience. Sweet Android 9. Battery could be a bit long lasting but dash charging takes care of that.	5
Best smartphone of the year 2018	5
I have only problem with sound quality and vibration motorOtherwise gret phone go for it	4
Amazing phone, premium to hold, just a piece of beauty, amazing camera and most of all value for money	5
Nice phone	4
It's value for money with bonus.Grab it without a single thought	5

Excellent product for performance	5
Best Flagship mobile at this price  and once again One Plus is best choice #NeverSettle	5
Superb in all aspects! Camera is outstanding. Good battery life,Great screen, Excellent performance. Affordable price compared to premium phones. Finger print  Sensor, face unlock are exciting features. Oxygen O/S is very fluid and smooth. Impressive rear &front Camera...What more can I ask for! Tottaly loving the device...I am happy Amazon!... Thanks a lot...!!!	5
The Product is very good quality and I feel very happy to use this Product and it's lightening fast and supports all kinds of Apps	5
Awesome phone	5
An amazing phone	5
Good mobile and good quality	5
OnePlus always bring latest & new technology on its mobile.	5
Amazing for the cost which they are selling	5
The phone value is not even 10000 rs. The camera is so bad. Flicking so much at video calling and slow motion camera. The slow motion videos are not working properly. And the worst part is Amazon where there is no option to return the item. I need my full money back. I can't tolerate this phone a day more	1
Why I have given 3 stars sound is so loud were it's not that adorable.	5
Awesome it is but I haven't received new ear phones even though I did pre booking	5
The phone is just awesome and the look is very premium one must look forward to buy it without hesitation	5
Switched from I phone to this one, indeed this phone offers lot of features which an iOS user can't think of.UI of iOS is better however if you have budget to buy an I phone with larger memory only then go for it else this one is way better	5
I'm new to One plus series , this has been a ultimate product, this phone is damn fast. The rapid charging mode has to be appreciated	5
The photo quality is amazing but only thing, I could not find the option on how to reduce the resolution of picture bcs as everytime I don't click photos on full resolution which is occupying space on my phone.	4
Average	4
The phone is really great and have some lot of intresting features.Pros:The dash charging has a jaw dropping speed.The face unlock is also quiet fast.Android Pie + Oxygen Os makes the phone smooth and easy to use.Cons:The Screen is a fingerprint magnet.The brightness is not quiet bright.The battery life may not be enough for a gamer.There are some issues with the calls.As it is filled with weird sounds.	5
Absolutely Flagship3700 mah batterySnapdragon 845 beastIn display fingerprint decentFace unlocking faster i have ever seenUltimate package from one plusAbsolutely awesome phone loved it	5
Everything Is FineBut Inbuilt Fingerprint sensor making some delaySound Quality Is AwsomeDisplay Very Cute with water drop notch	5
All features are perfectly Best. Mainly the camera is awesome and battery back up is exrta long as expected.	5
Good Features ...	5
The phone is a power pack in all terms and aspects. Images on daylight are amazing with lots if details. Battery life is good and in daily use one can get a whole day backup with an amazing fast charging which is available with the dash charger. Performance is tremendously awesome. Nothing can be more smoother in this price segment. And it comes with android 9.0 within the box. And within 4 days I have got 2 new ota updates and now it is running android 9.0.5. which comes with even more fast in display finger print unlock.	5
Cool unlocking with a great experience.	5
Amazon delivered this beauty ontime. This is my first OnePlus device and I am just loving it. The device is very smooth and performance is crisp. Only issue I am facing is with the battery life, it's draining very fast and surprisingly Google Play is consuming maximum power. I hope OnePlus will fix this with an update. Also, I am really impressed with the fast charging in this phone, it's superfast. Highly recommended.	5
Finally found the worth of my money	5
A must needed phone	5
Battery life is amazing.. Overall one of the best phones available in the market..	5
Bettery is draining very fast and also conpared to one plus 6 bettery where 6 has 3300 mah and last upto 1 day and 6T has 3700 mah and last upto 7 hour. Also volume is auto leveling while using it over bluetooth devices. I would like to exchange with different handset i think i got defective product.	1
Just got hands on this phone, being a customer for Samsung s8 and s9, this phone is not even close to UI or premium feel, yes games are a little faster, but rest not a great feel about this phone. Phone pictures are warm, camera focus isn't that great. Don't understand what the fuss is all about this phone. spend few thousands more and get the real premium phone S8+/s9+ you will love it. Delivery was on time. So over all experience and rating out of 5 will be 3 stars.	3
Really super phone	5
The best smart phone	5
Product is awesome just one pblm with Amazon...cant u able to provide the invoice of the bill in email	5
I love this phone	5
Oh just loved it. I am now a one plus Big fan.. everything about this phone is awesome. I don't want to waste your time in writing pros and cons as everyone knows about one plus 6t.The delivery was delayed by 2 days so giving 4 stars. Didn't expect something like this from Amazon.	4
HiThis is to inform you that I am facing an issue with fingerprint sensor.When l am trying to set fingerprint password getting a message"partial fingerprint detected please completely cover the identification area".I have also called the onepluscare and have tried all possible ways to overcome this problem as discussed by onepluscare agent.should I return this device or is there any other solution, please revert me asap with best one.Thanks	4
Worth it	5
Amazing experience of using this phone.It's my dream phone.Oneplus 6T. I love it!!!	5
Best performance. !!!!!	5
Don't think much just buy this. It's the best phone available in the market.	5
AWESOME PRODUCT. CAMERA QUALITY IS UNEXPRESSBLE .	5
Worst service from amazon.never expected this.lost believe in this.they delivered defective piece and not providing the replacement for this.Horrible ecperience	1
Flagship killer .	5
No doubt the best as always.	5
Used for one day . Played heavy games . No lags superfast phone.battery also good.camera upto the mark.	5
OnePlus6T was an amazing smartphone that I have ever experienced it was more than my expectations. People who are going to buy this smartphone just go ahead and experience for yourself it won't disappoint you....	5
Brilliant phone. Love that fingerprint scanner hopefully should get faster..Camera is amazing	5
There's some sort of unstablness during slow motion , and heating during charging , showing your app isn't responding repeatedly, not showing call logs , most important.. finger print sensor doesn't work as expected ...... I hope it gets fixed with an update...	4
Worth it	4
Arrived before time I m so excited about the 6t.Such a lovely phone	5
Okay so writing this review after 5 days use. I'll keep it sweet & simple. Camera & Battery life are unbeatable. Even people go crazy after seeing the in-built fingerprint sensor & the teardrop notch design gives this thing a look you can't forget . Build quality is more than superb. Those who say that poco f1 has the same processor don't really know what they're talking about & these two devices are way apart & poco doesn't stand anywhere in competition to 6T. Great product OnePlus & last but not least insanely fast delivery by amazon . Heads up!	5
Camera I am still exploring how to improve pics as I still find note 8 taking better pics, but rest of features are just too good. Screen sensor is lightening fast, phone is very responsive.  Battery backup is decent (far better than my note 8). Other missing area is notification alert.	4
Best phone I ever used, but I don't understand why there is no duel speaker, that could have add more value to the phone. Never the less best phone ever.	4
	5
This is my 1st one plus mobile its amazing I happy, camera shoot low light best.	5
Awesome product love it 	5
Great mobile	5
This is absolute beast of a phone. Love every aspects of it. I find no issues with the headphone jacks and notification led. You need to get a little used to it. The speed is phenomenal. All in one, this phone is absolute love.	5
Taste of speed !	5
Performance looks Speed it's great  .......	5
Great phone	5
Everything is super good. I have been a android from the beginning, this is an entirely new and smooth Android experience. Oxygen OS did it. Totally burden less UI. Camera is the best of all. But nightscape is disappointing compared to google pixel.	5
OnePlus is really winning the heart of users with their own mark!!	4
I think this phone is overrated. Quality wise it is good, but photos has very low pixel quality. Finger print scanner is also not working fast.Gaming and processing speed is awesome. Never gets hang.	3
Best phone	5
Realy looks good and worth to buy... Compare between 6 and 6T price cost is very high.. Changing slight changes added 10k extra.. Its too much....	5
Love it	5
This is my first experience with one plus .One plus 6t is pretty impressive. Gud battery backup , finger print scanner is real  quick , display is amazing , camera is mind blowing,......... Now waiting  for the bullet earphones .	5
No words for this beast just buy n experience its power	5
One+ 6t is awsomeone  phone . Nice look and loudspeaker....nice  product	4
Super super super	5
Ordered Oneplus 6T on 5th November, recvd the item on 8th November morning.I purchased this phone with a lot of expectations & at a heavy price, however to my shock I seem to have received a defective phone.have been facing MAJOR issues with this phone as follows:-  unable to take a photo with Front Camera with flash and it gives a yellowish blurring image before clicking the actual picture.-  When we zoon in the and take photo at night or day then image quality come worse of worse.- 3700 mah battery drains in half day even though I am not a heavy user, phone gets heated soon.-  MOST IMPORTANTLY the phone gives a SHOCK LIKE SENSATION if held phone in hand for 3-5mins,the effect of which remains on hand for almost hour which is life threatening..I raised a complaint on 12th November, i was informed the concerned team would call back within 24hrs , no update/ call till date.Kindly replace this defective phone with a new original phone of Oneplus 6T	3
Good smartphone	5
First of all Thanks Amazon for sending it on Time but upset that unable to club the offer of free ear phones with no cost emi.It's my first one plus phone so there was excitement.Phone is fast n furious no doubt . Simple and easy to used. Picture quality is amazing . Earpiece volume is low . Comparatively low for both ear piece . Don't have interest in gaming so can't tell about gaming. Company fitted scratcguard is of not that great quality. It got scractes on first day used. No music player App apart from Google play. Battery life is good .I am heavy internet user so Battery life is awesome. So it's half review. Probably after one month I can tell you about final review.	4
As a introductory launch I got cash back offers and mobile is very good	5
The phone is simply super and it works super fast.	4
Gud quality	5
Amazing product of one plus team till date.Fastest, Easiest, Simplest and Value for Money	5
Awesome phone.. go for it	5
I love this phone so much that I can't begin to explain it the low light photos are just amazing .... The split screen feature is amazing it makes me do two things together and that is just perfect ... The gestures and everything is just perfect ... I can't begin to say how much I love the phone..  thank you hubby for the gift ...	5
Just one word for one plus 6t"Awesome"Go for it	5
Good product battery life is very nice i got 10-11 hours of screen on time on wifi and normal usage notch is not an issue with this phome as you can hide it in the settings. comes android pie and nov security patch out of the box. Overall a great purchase in 35500.( Including bullets)	5

Excellent product by one plus also amazon delivery is superb	5
Osmm phone ...loved it	5
Awesome mobile met my expectation as always.. oneplus 3T still a better phone but you will find it becomes slower only if you start using 6T. This phone is for sure worth for the money paid...	5
Phone with all richness	5
You can't get a better finished and better quality product with such flagship features at better price! Don't compare this with other cheaper phone promising equal/better flagship features! They have a lot of cost cuttings and the experience suffers! Not with this device! There are hardly any compromises here! Except for the lack headphone-jack! A near perfect device!	5
Pixels fat rahe h thode... Otherwise all are good	5
Proud to be a oneplus 6T holder.. awesome productThanks Amazon for fast delivery	5
Very fast and smooth... Go for it.	5
Unlock the speed	5
The Best Smartphone, Till Date. Best in picture quality, Best in sound quality & The battery life is amazing. The phone charges pretty fast & I just love it.	5
Amazing sound qualityLong Battery lifePicture quality is good	5
It's an excellent product	5
Just 1 word - Awesome	5
Amazing phone, highly recommended A++++++	5
This device is clearly ahead of its pack for the hardware and features provided in this price range. Since everyone is well aware of the specs I'll just provide my experience while using this device.1. Sharp well balanced pictures during daytime and nightscape mode does a decent effort to reduce graininess and camera shake while taking night shots with low ISO settings. Still room for improvement though.2. As for sound quality I never use phone speakers while listening to music and prefer my Bluetooth headphones as I hate wires. I'm glad headphone jack is absent. One less vestigial organ to worry about as we move forward. Thank you oneplus. Call clarity is good as expected.3. Marriage of bloatfree oxygen os alongwith snapdragon 845 makes this phone a pure joy to use. Fast snappy and responsive! In screen fingerprint sensor though takes more time to unlock than the physical one at the back earlier, but this has been hid well by the animations provided.4. Battery life is excellent and I'm using dark theme which further reduces battery consumption. Gives me more than one day of usage without playing any games.5. Body has been exquisitely crafted and with the gorilla 6 screen and teardrop notch this is one of  the best displays you can get at present. I would have still preferred a metal unibody instead of the glass back though.All in all I would say you'd feel proud and satisfied to own this device. If you can shell out the extra dough go for the 8 gb versions. Thumbs up to Oneplus for another great product and for not "settling" !	5
Performing like a beastLoving it Thankyou 1+ 	5
Awesome mobile phone good battery pikcup and picture quality ,sound quailty...and Amazon service so good time to delivered .	5
Excellent phone, waiting for it a long time.Superfast processor make it unbeatable.It's not only a great phone but also increased your personality.	5
The tagline is the perfect mark of the phoneI haven't experienced that much speed even in iPhone. I loved the dash charge feature, battery life , mirror black look gives the phone a sexier look .Only the thing I not getting satisfied with is the picture quality coz when you zoom it the pixels burst out so here I prefer the iPhone's picture quality . But all in this phone is BEAST and gonna change perception of people from iPhone to One plus .	5
Amazing super fast  phone .....like bullet	5
Simply the fastest phone ever.Great camera and decent speakers. Don't really miss the headphone jack as everything I have is Bluetooth.In display fingerprint scanner makes you feel a part of a SciFi movie every time you unlock the phone	5
Great product.. but need some camera improvements.	5
The OnePlus 6T could be a really nice phone notwithstanding what the value, however at half the price of AN iPhone XS with a newest in show fingerprint sensing element this can be the cut-price get of the year. everyone is complaining regarding in-display fingerprint scanner is slow however trust American state its terribly in no time, the phone gets unbolted as shortly as your finger touches the screen and a lot of correct than alternative phones, this can be the smartphone that brings all-screen style up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that the newest technology doesnt need to value the world, delivery AN in-display fingerprint scanner and a small notch for simply 37K. The attractive, crisp and vibrant OLED show could be a whit larger at half dozen.41in, with a smaller chin at very cheap is just wonderful, coming back to the camera the new nightscape low lightweight mode will an honest job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is additionally pretty sensible Portrait mode works as publicized, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is nice and once you use the fingerprint sensing element the night mode for the show is disabled quickly and so fades back in once youve unbolted the phone. The phone comes with a screen guardian already thereon. the one bottom-firing speaker is loud and includes a comparatively great amount of bass for the phone, however, is definitely blocked whereas enjoying a game. OnePluss alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and continues to be good. OnePlus phones have continually been sensible for the money, providing prime specifications in well-built devices, however not pushing the boundaries of whats doable. Thats modified for the OnePlus 6T. it's pushing whats doable with the favored all-screen style employing a small, enticing teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and its a more robust phone for it. however it's the introduction of a newest in-display fingerprint scanner, ANd creating it works rather well for as very little as [*fr1] the value of an iPhone XS, that's most spectacular. theres no wireless charging, it doesnt have any of the flowery 3D face systems of some and it's a bit plain, however, everything else is a prime notch. Even the software package expertise is superb.Pros:- sensible battery life, nice screen, wonderful performance, dual-sim, sensible camera, Bluetooth five, nice software package, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensing element, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, cheap worth relative to premium phones, last however not least Blazing quick software packageCons:- No notification lightweight, glass back, however, no wireless charging, no expandable storage.Overall the phone is superb and it very delivers it's tagline ne'er Settle.Being an Amazon pre-BookingStill Delivery Was postponed by a day And Packing is extremely Poor.....	4

All feature are good	5
ordered this phone for my brother and trust me it's really good at the price point!!	5
Very fast delivery with amazon in just 12hrs,  A very good product of one plus,  Face lock on time. Camera is outstanding , Fantastic phone,  Worthy for 42k.  Battery life is good.	5
Cool	5
ok	5
I'm not satisfied with the product because the battery backup is too much worst... don't waste you're money from this mobile	4
I'm a fan of Oneplus. OP 6T is really great in build quality, slightly thicker than oneplus 3 but that feels good in hands. On comparing photos with my OP 3 then OP 6T is a mood off. Also, the finger print scanner animation is very slow. It doesn't give you idea of the instant the phone will get unlocked, eventually making you keep finger for more time. And this happens every time. I still prefer my OP 3 over my dad's OP 6T in terms of low-light photograph and fingerprint. Also, fingerprint animation is poor in UI. Display of phone is nice though.	3
It's awesome	5
It is soo nice phone	5
Awesome phone	5
Overall performance is good. It doesn't have dual speaker. 3 attempt required to download single app in play store	4
Have been using it for a day. I have used one plus 5t earlier. The camera and performance is increased incredibly!!	5
I just need to ask the one who buy 6t about the battery life and dash charging. It took me exactly 1 hour and thirty minutes to get my phone full charged.And in 8 hrs and 30 minutes  the battery drains to 38% ...what I did was jz watched a movie....no calls nothing much....Is the same happening with others too....I am a bit confused as the most I heard about one plus 6t was about dash charging and battery lifePlease help as I need to confirm whether I received a defective piece	3
The best one	5
I will give 4.5 for Picture quality, sound quality and battery life	4
Nice phone, fast n smooth. Some time unable to download app. That's issue.	5
Amazing	5
Great beast, worth for money and especially the finger print touch rockssss.Premium Use.	5
I ordered the phone on 1st November 2018. Got it delivered on the same day itselfTremendous improvement by Oneplus in terms of Camera Quality. The night mode photos are brilliant.The inDisplay finger print sensor is fast and accurateThe notch in beautifully designed and will make you likeeeee the phone even more	5
Improve battery life	5
It is a really nice phone	5
The OnePlus 6T  is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.......Great battery lifeFluid performanceTop-end designImpressive rear camera.......	5
this is fukkknnn awesome. go for it.	5
Am using it from Nov 2nd. It is a magnificent phone. Bigger batter makes phone to stand out more. If any one ask me for a premium phone to buy I'll suggest them OnePlus 6t.	5
Just awesome, loving it's camera quality and battery performance...	5
Worth  - only android phone which replaces iPhone's performance	5
I have received the phone ... nice service and the product is excellent... one plus 6t	5
Nice awesome phone. Camera clarity is chanceless. Face unlock and indisplay finger sensor is working fine. Dual speakers r rocking.	5
King of all kingsPerformance Display And finger print in screen scanner 	5
Awesome	4
Everything feels fabulous.... And i don't know what rubbish are these people saying about the in screen fingerprint scanner it works like a charm and its almost as fast as the normal one... Go for  worth every rupee 	5
Great piece.. Great speed.. Picture quality awesome. Face recognition works better than expected.	5
Awesome	5
My first one plus phone and I have opted for the ryt one great camera with perfect dash charger ... A complete phone ... Keep up the good work OnePlus	5
I m waiting for coupon code to purchase c earphone	5
Best phone ever used 	5
awesome mobile... fabulous picture quality, slow motion, night mode and royal look	5
A good phone	5
The best of the best at much better price.	5
Took the plunge and upgraded from my perfectly fine oneplus 3t. I was looking for a camera, storage and battery upgrade so 6t checks all the boxes. I miss the headphone jack as it's an inconvenience to carry that usb dongle everywhere. It comes installed with android pie and man it's buttery smooth. Thanks to oneplus community, software and user experience is something which oneplus takes very seriously. In screen Fingerprint sensor is pretty good but not quite as fast as the physical sensor. However the difference is minor.  Camera is same as oneplus 6 with some software improvements. Bigger battery makes a difference and I am getting 7 hours of SOT. A screen protector is pre-applied on the phone and comes with a silicone case in the box. Although it does the job but I would recommend to get a sturdy bumper case. No need to apply any tempered glass on the screen.Hate the fact oneplus keep on increasing the prices for every new model and I fear it might reach that flagship price 40k+ very soon.Overall I liked the phone and wish oneplus could launch it with more colors than just black.	5
Battery drains quickly.. phone gets heated while using camera... Other than these 2 issues everything else is great ... Feel a premium phone videos n pictures are awesome. U should not use headphones while charging so 3.5 mm jack is not required. C type connector works great.	5
most powerful phone, price, quality everything is best in IndiaI got hdfc 1500+1000 amazone payback+4000 for exchange +5000 cashback on jio  : now do the math	5
Picture quality and sound quality  is  very good . The battery life is better compared to 6  and it will easily last for a day	5
Everything except the battery could have been much better, plus no headphone jack is a huge bummer, oneplus should give free wireless headphones with this phone.	2
Best in present phones	5
	5
Amazing ! As always OnePlus rocks !!	5
You might find cheaper phones with similar specifications but you won't find the quality build and level of performance provided by 6T within the price range. The phone lives up to the hype. Its a true geeks companion. The huge number of settings available might overwhelm someone who is only using phones to click selfies and tiktok videos. Picture quality is undeniably good. Sound quality is amazing. Battery life extends upto 24 hours. Dash charging FTW. Power management is great. Stock OS is the best. No longer there's a NEED to flash some custom ROM unless you WANT to. In the end it all boils down to how you treat your phone. Be it any phone. Treat the device well. And let the device show you what true performance is. Money well spent.	5
Fingerprint scanner like does not works at all, so slow n many time it doesn't open also	4
The 6t is good and fast. However, the functioning of fingerprint scanner is suboptimal.	4
When will I get type C bullet headset and when should I add that gift card ?	5
Purchased recently need to review after 6 months	4
Phone is working very fast everything is properly functioning only front camera is not that much good as expected if you are using iPhone than don't go for Android because there is nothing better than crome mode in front camera of iPhone and if you want speed than this is perfect for this	5

This Phone is like a dream phone. Its a bit heavy on the price but damn is it worth it. I had used a OnePlus 3 earlier and i found this is a worthy upgrade. The new bigger battery can last an entire day with still 20% juice left in it. The indisplay fingerprint sensor is upto mark though not that quick with the traditional one, but it sure does the job efficiently.	5
Good mobile.	5
Mobile is good but they give me a faulty camera which takes photos poor that one plus 2 and then they are not ready to replace, it is one case in thousands but it should be addressed. Worst service by Amazon	4
Worth buying	5
good quality device similar like as one plus 5	4
Excellent battery life and charging, great camera and surprisingly good display and speakers!	5
In Love with this device, the picture quality is so richThe real beast is here, I saw people comparing cheap Poco with this Premium device.Pros :Fastest in display finger print sensorNavigation GesturesBigger batteryNo cons as of nowWell if you are switching from a older device rather than one plus 6, this will is a best upgrade	5
Nice fast, smooth and big 6.41" Amoled display pleasing. Phone very fast and smooth without any lagging at all. Battery backup is awesome improvement. Camera also good improvement. They covered overall every aspect and this is real flagship killer.	5
From LCD to this superb AMOLED display was the first thing that struck me while switching from previous budget phones to this device. The tech specs didn't bother me much since the previous phones I've used was far below this. The camera did surprise me but didn't quite meet the hype. The night scape feature was a let down. From 3 days usage it deserve a 5 star rating.	5
I got broken phone	1
It's awesome	5
Sometimes missed the headphone jack while driving. Other than that this device is a superb package. Few things OnePlus users alone knows,especially in software tweaks done by OnePlus. Stop complaining about the things which are not in the phone(after knowing we buy) enjoy the beast.	5
Awesome mobile. You won't regret after buying it except for battery.Battery discharges very fast. One plus guys plz do something for this.	4
Awesome product, camera quality was good and battery and performance was good.. worthable for money.. android kha baap this mobile..I like very much one plus mobile.	5
Very nice product... i like it!	4
Its a great mobile but I am audio jack is with charging point is not good	4
I was oneplus 3t user before buying this.. OnePlus is best in terms of updates. It just an amazing phone with blazing fast speed. Main thing is now it come with 128gb base variant.Battery life is seriously good compare to oneplus 3t or even oneplus 6.Sound quality is expected loud enough.You can go for it anytime.	5
Product, service every thing good but back cover quality very poor.	5
Beast in budget .. fan of oneplus. .But there is no need to buy oneplus 6T if u have oneplus 6 ..Nightscape mode works perfectly .. 1 day delivery by Amazon.Thanks ..	5
excited one	5
You can never find something better in market than OnePlus. OnePlus 6T is just amazing the smoothness in operation n the underdisplay fingerprint is appreciable.	5
Amazing phone loved it and proud to be a member of OnePlus community...	5
True Competitor to Google Pixel 3 Worth 75K, Excellent Device go ahead and buy it.	5
Awesome device with a premium look. Fully satisfied with my new Oneplus 6t. Also the fingerprint works very well.	5
Bestest ever phone. Super speed. Duo network.	5
All good	5
Bought this phone overall I think goodOnly thing as of now ifound slow motion video..not good...it's blinking...donno it's only in my phone?	4
Awesome phone I would recommend	5
Flagship in budget	5
Awesome mobile worth for money	5
I haven't seen any app in play store which can slow this phone down.	5
The flagship to try	5
Really a nice over come over 6 it been hard to carry over 3.5 jack converter But improve in battery life and newer invuild technology it's ok and perfect	4
Amazing product in this segment.Cool display!Amazing Fast Processor!Good Camera! (Best in Day light & with improved night mode)Actually its the Speed you Need!Best phone that challenges the high end flagships with a great price!	4
Superb phone	5
No comments for oneplus.... Exceptionally the best product as usual.... Superb picture, sound quality on speakers and headphones... Games works like charm and blazing fast speed for loading.... Absolutely no lag.... Easily fits pocket and beats exceptionally heavy prices smartphones in features, quality, durability of Samsung and apple of the world's.	5
Picture Quality : Very GoodCamera : Good.. not very good. Night mode is very goodBattery Life: Its good (i hope its because it is new). I use the mobile throughout the day..(music, internet over 4G and Wifi)	5
Indeed it is flagship killer. All the best features in an affordable price range.	5
awesome phone with great specs at excellent price	5
Quality is awosom	5
Best	4
Good product	5
Everything ok but battery life is not as expected.Earlier I was using Redmi Note 4 , compared to that phone it has 60% life only.I am not a heavy user just in sociel media usages it lasts 8-9 hrs only.	3
The phone arrived in a properly sealed packet. The delivery agent didn't wait up for product verification. The picture quality of the rear camera is excellent in the given price bracket. Sound quality has improved a lot since i was a one plus 3 user so I can bet on the same. Battery life easily lasts for 1 day with a heavy usage.	5
The fluidic Operating System is working amazingly.Best phone to have. Super-cool on screen unlock, best screen and amazing camera with really long battery backup. Best of the OnePlus.Oneplus 6 users you just really do not need to upgrade as Oneplus is providing updates in the camera and UI as same as Oneplus 6T.Old OnePlus phones users you really need to unlock the speed with 6 or 6T	5
I m Getting hanging issue in my new cell and I have not installed any New apps which can harm this cellFeeling low battery backup and camera clearity in low light is not good as expected	4
Super	5
Awesome product	5
Amazing mobile. After using PixelXL I find this a very good alternative for stock Android phone. Best transition ever.	5
OnePlus 6T has good speed, battery life & great camera	5
Here's the benchmark, op6t just defeated them all except the asus ROG Phone a gaming phone.	5
Battery life and charging both are awesome...	5
I just loved the mobile.	5
Stunning phone wish the sound could be less it's like a mini Bluetooth.	5
Another flagship killer from one plus	5
Great phone	5
Very good picture quality	5
I liked the product very much...it's awesome in the case of Sound and picture quality and Battery life also Great.	5
Good product	5
Though the battery is 3700 mah .it is not giving that much of back up as i expected.	5
It's a premium phone with good battery life and camera, it's sound is also nice, I m waiting for it's type c ear phone as a prebook offer in amazon	5
The fingerprint sensor is not always detecting properly. And there are few bugs, but not so critical.	4
No lag whatsoever.Camera quality awesome but improvement required in low light photographyDisplay sharp and colour are vibrantFingerprint sensor is fine as now used to it.Faceunlock is blazing fastBattery lasts for more than one day and icing on the cake is dash chargeAll in all value for the moneyJust go for it	5
Best till now 	5
Super fast mobile	5
I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!	5
Superb	5
It's my first OnePlus phone. Phone is amazing and performance is outstanding. Overall super Speed phone.	5
Phone is completely awesome..... overall good specifications.... definitely you can go for this device in this price range......I got this device for 35000......	5
Good	4
Liked it a lot	5
oneplus is known for performance and 6t is no exception. this thing flies anything i throw at it. it has one of the best cameras in this price range. audio is good, not loud like front stereo speakers but does it's work. i never liked down facing speakers and being on the left side it often gets suppressed by my palm. so far this is the only thing i hate about this phone. the 2nd best thing of this phone is the battery life. i haven't tested it fully but the battery is crazy good. if you've a budget of 40k then this is one of the best, if not the best.	5
Best battery life...observed. clear and sharp sound in the ear during calls. Great screen.	5
Good	5
Very good Quality of Picture, Sound Quality & Battery Life.	5
phone is working very good.display,battery life,sound everything is ok.	5
Battery life is much longer than oneplus 3T. Picture quality is just awesome. Pro phone...make me feel royal when i take it into hand. Love oneplus.	5
True flagship killer !! Loved it 	5
I purchased it for my friend it really a better flagship phone.If Your Budget Is upto 40k then undoubtedly go for it.	5
Phone is vary fast, camara is awesome and battery last about 1.5 day.	5
Superb just go for it...	5
After one plus one to one plus 6t.. Wonderful feeling. Amazing phone. Best build quality, fast charging, futuristic finger print lock. And amazing camera. Go for it.	5
No 3.5mm earphone jack	4
awesome in every aspect	5
Face Lock System is really faster than expected... Display is one of important feature that cannot be excluded,it gives nice display i have ever seen...Picture captured is of great quality...	5
I Love	5
It is just another phone one plus have produced. Can say flawless.Pros:DisplayPerformanceLow light photography using nightscapeCameraBattery lifeConsOff course no headphone jack ( I have been using for a week and still finding difficult to carry typeC to headphone cable)Price could have been 2-3K lesser	5
Best currently android mobile phone in market.With Excellent camera quality.	5
It is the greatest phone ever! Good hardware combined with excellent software.6T ticks all the boxes of the modern day flagships, plus it has in-display fingerprint which is surprisingly fast and more convenient than the one mounted on the back.It has improved battery backup, large storage options at relatively same price, excellent memory management and the best UI you will find on a phone.The Oxygen OS gives you the latest offerings from Android and is very responsive and very pleasing just to look at! It gives you a lot of customisation options to make your phone feel more personal.The only small setback is an average camera. But don't worry, it's pretty good and can do a great job capturing images and won't disappoint you.This is the best buy for 30-40k budget segment and you won't regret buying it.I am very happy with this phone. Oneplus!	5
Phone was perfect... But it's dual speaker .. right speaker not working..  m not getting what going on.. and not expecting this things ..	3
Best in the market..Highly recommend..	5
Excellence product	4
Including the discount I got OP6t at 34.5k. I have been using this phone heavily  for 3days now. Worth mentioning the Oxygen OS is one of the best in market and has the capability to challenge the IOS. Its a bliss to play games in OP 6t.  Camera is good and specially the nightscape mode.Charging is very fast with the dash charger. Fingerprint and face unlock is swift. This is a kind of phone you can easily recommend to someone.But they could have easily added the headphone jack.Cheers to one plus. They should keep up the good work.	5
Loved the design	5
Everything is amazing in this phone	4
Loved each and every feature. Just one star less for the on screen finger print scanner which works slower than other finger print scan.Also, the phone is heavier as compared to other one plus phones	4
Not much to say but brilliant phone it is awesome performance	5
Battery life is good...	3
Great phone.....worth for money.	5
I cannot find words to tell about the product.but gadget is awesome at overall	5
The phone is good also the delivery was on time as mentioned	5
This phone has everything that I need. Great camera quality, phone speed, clear display and high battery life. Price as compared to other phones with the same features is much good.	5
Awesome to use so far	5
Wonderful phone. Totally worth it.	5
Excellent mobile with nice camera and new fingerprint scanner.Notch display is awesome.Pros - Phone's weight,Notification light missing	5
Good phone but price is too high in comparison to market. Fast as told camera upto mark same as 6 it should be improved.	5

Ultimate phone.... Best phone in its range.	5
Beast of a Phone, ordered it last night.. received it this morning lol	5
Awesome mobile..nice camera and battery back up.very fast processors. A good deal within this budget	5
Battery life is going to over lit bit faster.....	4
Picture quality is top notch with limited notch	5
Value for money smartphone	5
Selfie camera is not that much superior need to work on..	5
This is awesome...	5
I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.	1
If u r looking for best mobile in budget of ~35k then go for oneplus 6t ..	5
 Simply awesomeFP Scanner Facial recognition is excellent even in low light conditionsGreat camera and picture quality5/5 for this one	5
Ultimate phone	5
Speed is good and battery backup is awesome..	5
Everything is good, except speakers right side speakers are not working	4
Amazing phone to buy	5
Just one word AWESOME,total value for money, the bestest camera i have ever used, go for it.#the_best	5
Face unlock is very slow and very poor in low light as compared to Vivo V11 pro face unlock.	3
Phone is really great with fast and smooth in every use. During first use finger unlock sensor is quite undetectable sometimes as it detect tyour finger in the same you at exact same location you registered. If your finger is little tilted also it wond detect. Overall it is great. The face unlock is also extremely fast, it wont take any time for animations. The port converter type-C to 3.5mm jack is not working.	5
Best	5
Performance	5
So far so good.. but not big difference when compare OnePlus 6	5
Awesome phne.love it	5
It taken us to next levelAwesome productWorth phone	5
Terrible. First phone was returned as it was heating up. Replaced. Now returning the second one as it has began heating up in 5 days.	1
I was note 8 user,i sold my note and got one plus 6t ,best killer phone 2018,camera and screen and battery is awesome	5
Thanks for this amazing mobile	5
Flawless fon with extreme graphics and well built. Comes with in-box back cover which is awesome and already applied screen protector. Touch is smoother than ever. Pubg wont hang even once.   Edges are good and the fon has a big screen which makes watching video more entertaining. On screen fingerprint scanner wasn't needed but face recognition is faster. Camera quality is fair and front camers makes ur face look good.   Best quality fon in this price range. Just go for it.	5
My first One plus device fabulous phone Everything is premium just go for it	5
The phone is awesome. Performance wise it is fast. Pictures are really very cool. Speed is good. Unlocking phone is fast. Overall good phone with most of the latest features installed in it.Just one thing is that battery could have been better.	5
Wow it's too good superb...Awesome mobile.	5
Never bother about the on screen touch I'd. It has some problem but again you have face unlock. Performance, battery, screen quality are real premium.	5
Amazing Phone. Total powerful performance phone. Excellent in every aspect. Fingerprint sensor needs some big improvement.b	5
To sum it up in a sentence I would say that it is very fast... The phone responds within a fraction of a second be it calling someone or opening up browser or any application...Icing on the cake is that it does not overheat easily... I played pubg for almost two hours and it never heated up above the normal heat... And the battery consumption was only 25%... Amazing...The fingerprint sensor works 4 out of 5 times... This one might need some improvement or some software updates but it's better than most ones out there... When it works it unlocks in less than a second...Photos at night time came out really good... Day time pictures were crisp and natural... Need to check other modes as well when I get the chance...	5
Best smartphone ever in excellent budget	5
I preordered this phone but I don't get type c bullet earphones anyone can tell me how can I get these earphones free.	5
I have been waiting for OnePlus 6t for about 3-4 months. I already made up my mind that i will buy this phone only and that decision was the best.Using this phone for 2-3 days only but i have seen-:amazing picture qualityBooming soundSmooth as butter operationsAmazing processing speedAwesome battery lifeLightning speed chargingAnd the list goes on...........The thing which i was a little disappointed are -:Missing 3.5 mm jack (they will give you a converter though and many of us now have Bluetooth earphones)In screen fingerprint sensor is not very fast it still need regular software updatesBut all and all amazing phone and must buy	5
Great device suggesting this to everyone	4
Amazing Phone ...	5
Awesome phone...Don't believe negative reviews abt the phone... Sound quality (even though audio jack is not there) is very good..picture quality excellent asusual superb.. Good battery backup... Fingerprint scanner speeds up after update...	5
The cameras could have improved.	5
The phone looks awesome in your hand ! Looks extremely attractive .. camera is amazing	5
Very good oneplus phone. I am replacing from oneplus3 and it is an excellent replacement. The speed and indisplay fingerprint scanner are the best. Bigger battery and fast charging is a bliss. The sound quality of speaker is awesome. Camera user interface needs some improvement. I didnt explore the camera enough to comment but I think studio lighting and night scape features require an update.Amazon delivery was excellent. I am waiting for the pre-order freebies. I look forward to an option to get wired bullet earphone or get 1499 off against wireless bullet. Overall i am happy with oneplus experience but i look forward to more on camera front which i am sure will be delivered via future software updates.	5
Superb phone with awesome look and performance...!!!I'm using 3T before changed to 6T ...my 2 days experience is awesome ....sound and video quality is good....!!! Battery lifetime is good lasting long...!!!Thank you oneplus :-)	5
Love 2 have one plus 6t , amazing build quality, oxygen interface is the best I can say ,over all great ,,,,	5
OnePlus 6T is my first OnePlus device and I'm in love with this phone, 6T is the fastest flagship phone I have used till date I'm saying this dispute being a Apple Sheep for some time. OP6T has good battery life, Powerful processor for fast multitasking, amazing Graphic Processing power that can chew through graphic intense Games like PUBG-M,Fortnite and Asphalt 9 with ease, The Phone has good RAM management, decently loud speakers, Dash Charging works as advertised, OLED Display is decent with accurate colour reproduction, Tear Drop Notch is non-intrusive during Gaming and watching Movies (Though you have options to completly hide it), Thin side Bezel smaller chin add a very immersive experience during enjoying videos streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, APV, Twitch, etc.. dispite the lower availability of content that would take advantage of the phones aspect ratio.The phone dose comes with few Bloatwares which can be uninstalled, Oxygen OS is simple to use & as close to stock Android OS.Call Quality, cellular connectivity, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth are excellent.In-display Fingerprint scanner "Just works" with blazing fast Facial unlock.Camera is perfect in segment with ability to shoot decent photographs and 4K videos @60FPS.The Phone is well built/designed with Glossy Glass Body that gives it a premium feel and look.Amazon Delivery was fast dispite my remote location.	5
I have been using this device for over a week now and so far it has turned out to be a beast of a device. Here are my observations:1. The in-display screen unlocker: It is flawed. Takes a bit of a time to unlock and you have to place the finger properly. But this was not that big of a deal, since the face unlocking is supremely fast. Its a novelty kind of thing. looks nice when it works. 4/5 for this2. Camera: my previous device was OP 5t. The picture quality has increased manifold. Nightscape, studio lighting and ultra slo-mo video works like a charm. 5/5 for this3. Battery life: the first day, the device got slightly heated when i used oneplus switch so the battery drained quickly. But over the week, it has given me wonderful battery backup. No heating issue. With average to heavier usage, it still gave me 1.5 days backup. The charging is very fast. 40 minutes to charge from 10 to 95%. More than sufficient. 4.75/5 for this4. Speaker: Only one speaker is present, but it gives out very loud output. Gives very good clarity and loud ringing. No complaints or issues regarding this. 5/55. OS: It is the cleanest and simplest OS yet. Lots and lots of customization, minimum bloatware. clean interface. in OP5T, the messaging app did not differentiate between marketing related messages and actual messages. fortunately, this phone has that capability. Loved the gestures as well. Optimizations are also great new feature. 5/56. Build: All one plus devices are wonderfully built and 6T is no exception. Even though the glass back is there, I didnt find any slippage. Of course I am using the back cover which is already provided with the phone now. But I think it has much better grip than the other phones. 5/5Bottom line is that this is a device which you would want to own for a long time. Most of the budget phones start developing problems within 1 year of manufacturing, but that has not been my experience with One plus devices.  Even after more than 1 year of using OP 5T, I still got the same performance I was getting during my first month with it. 6T is slightly costly but completely worth it in my opinion.	5
Can put pixel 3 to shame	5
Pros:1. Brilliant display2. Excellent camera3. In built fingerprint scanner is quite fast (bit slower than the physical one)4. DASH CHARGE is just awesome.5. Very good battery lifeCons: The only con is that there is no headphone jack, and i hate charging my wireless headsets every now and then.	5
Good product.amazing experience	4
Bang bang bang	5
Very good phone I get this phone after two days of launch waited for 2 month and my it's satisfied me	5
Great phone!Speakers could be stereo though.	5
Great	4
There is nothing which I dislike the phone.... Above all  battery life is best	5
The phone bricked within a week of usage, had slowdown and was hanging from day 1. Apparently the phone is having a bad ROM. No replacement means I am now stuck with this phone and endless trips to service centers	1
Good camera and excellent performance	5
Nice look, good OS, user friendly...Need to improve finger print sensor working...	4
Beautiful phone it has pretty decent picture quality loved the battery backup	5
Nice phone	5
One of the speaker is not working, what to do man?	1
This is most expensive thing i have ever bought in my entire life and i really proud to have this beast in my pocket.this just perfect for me.Thank you one pluslove youThere not a single thing which it lacks.	5
Best phone I never had	5
Average camera quality and battery life, sound quality good, face unlock good, while capture photos in room light not real colour comes into photos	4
Nice mobile, worth it	4
There is no headphones	5
Battery life is very less, other features are Good.	4
It was awesome....	5
The speed is superb !! I earlier used one plus 5. Once you use one plus all other phones are not recommended.	5
Best phone of OnePlusBest in every class, screen unlocking is so fast	5
So far so good	4
Everything is excellent	5
Oneplus 6T is Awesome Phone..	5
Awesome phone	5
Have been using the phone from last 3 days till now it looks amazing and speed is super fast. Only drwaback I find is the fingerprint sensor.	5
Awesome picture quality and sound quality, best battery life	5
Switching over from my Iphone 8 to Oneplus 6t.1 - SpeedYes, Oneplus claims the truth that you're going to "Unlock Speed" with this one. The face unlock and brand new in display fingerprint in this phone is insanely fast.2- HardwareThe built quality of the phone gives you a very premium feel, glass back , amazing curved design, oled screen and teardrop notch can give a bummer to any other premium smartphone in the market.3- ProcessorDamn, I love this one, Snapdragon 845 and 8GB of RAM makes it one of the fastest phones in the world right now, get ready for an amazing never lagging gaming experience and user interface.4- SoftwareAndriod 9, Pie and Oxygen OS makes the interface of the phone look beautiful, and it looks beautiful to me as I've been using apple for past two years with same interface. Gestures, customizations and various other oxygen os features give you a very good in-phone experience.5- CameraAmazing for low light photography, I haven't test the camera much, would edit my review after testing it for sometime.CONS1- It would be great if Oneplus launches phones with IP water resistant certificate and Wireless Charging from next time.2- Include the Type C bullet earphones inside the box itself. They're out of stock on amazon.	5
Not an upgrade over one plus 6 but it's ok..Slightly overpricedFingerprint not that good physical fingerprints are better and faster	5
What a mesmerizing smartphone!!	5
Pros:-Display was good.camera clarity was superb..Indisplay finger print was really fast.battert life was goodCons:-removed 3.5mm jack. Price was little higher than expected.	5
Grt phone recommended to everyone best in class photo and looks	5
[picture and battery quality good naad khula	5
The phone is Legendary.Totally worth investing in this. Should be good for at least 3 years.I have purchased the 8GB+128GB combo and it's definitely worth the price.	5
Loved it	5
Awesome and Solid Mobile...	5
Premier look wonderful features . But lil overpriced	5
Picture quality is not up to the mark (7/10)But one of the best quality mobile is it's performance.Finger print sensor need some more updates.I just seen few of the reviews below that ppl are complaining about the display, but I totally disagree with those folks. I'm very much attracted for one plus 6t bcoz of it's AMOLED display more than the onscreen  fingerprint. Trust me display quality is flawless.Overall, worth buying it.	5
Awesome Phone... Blazing Fast...Just fingerprint scanner needs improvement...hope to see software fix for betterment.	5
Everything is best.	5
look so classy sexy look	5
Excellent	5
Nice mobile, good design, good looking,Battery excellent, camera, sounds, totally 10/10	5
Awesome phone	5
Go for it. It's awesome. Specially the battery backup is superb...	5
Everything working fine	5
Best product by one plus	5
I have been using 6T since 2 days now. It's been a wonderful experience. Amazon kept it's 1 day delivery promise. I am really happy own a phone with such a powerful cpu and amazing speed. Thanks OnePlus and Amazon	5
OnePlus 6t is great with its bigger battery.	5
	5
Excellent Phone..	5
Got the most amazing phone in the world while participating in Guinness World Record event at Mumbai. This is my first OP phone. I am feeling proud to be OP Community Member.	5
Excellent Product	5
Sound can be better  but it is good.	4
Like - Everything	5
Just AMAZING. You cannot go wrong with this phone. It is lightning fast. The gesture navigation is comparable to apple. I have never used an android phone as smooth as this one.The camera is also great but I have seen improvement in camera quality using the Pixel Camera App on OnePlus 6T.Sound is Okay.Only downside of this phone is the lack of Headphone jack but that is fine.Overall I am very satisfied with this phone and would definitely recommend it.	5
Battery life is nice, pictures qualify quite good - overall nice product	4
The best smartphone	5
1.Screen is awesome.2.Sound quality is excellent.3.Unlocking is fast and fancy.4.Camera quality is good.5.Battery life is best.6 obviously super fast.7.Dash Charging.	5
I liked the sound quality and picture quality. It's really awesome. And mobile speed and performance also very good. Today I have bought this mobile so Need to do more R&D on mobile. Then only I will get to know all.	5
Awesome phone in all aspects. Proud owner.	5
Don't buy this Mobile worst network connectivity also no support any service centres, in Maharashtra only 4 services centre unfortunately at my location 300 km from me I was so sad call centre suggest me you visit to service centre to resolve issues .....very slow browsing like 2G phones ...... camera is good but without connecting network it's like only photographer camera...	1
Camera Quality is kind of similar with other phone of less price	5
Amazon Delivery is excellent as always. Got it delivered within a day, that too, to my native city(Non Metro, not Bangalore).Coming to phone itself, had ordered Mirror Black 8/128 GB variant.Pros:1. Excellent build quality2. Great fluid smooth Oxygen OS3. Display is gorgeous. Feels bit longer and tad narrower than OnePlus 6's screen. (Tech spec also says so.)4. Felt sound quality over earphones (JBL E1+) is great... Compared to my previous OnePlus2. Felt comparatively better than OnePlus6. Though I don't have any test result to show, I just heard sound effects of same song on both OnePlus6 and 6T, Base and clarity of music on OnePlus 6T just felt refined if not same.5. Camera. Just awesome. Nightscape is good in low light. Very snappy camera. They r soft features which r coming to OnePlus 6 anyway.6. In Display fingerprint, well it's a good tech. Works well most of the time,even though not as fast as physical sensor. Did a false unlock with non registered finger when I was testing . It happened just once. Bleeds bright light from the sensor area while unlocking,(well that's how it's technology work)which might be annoying during night with sleepy eyes. Face unlock works like a charm.Its even faster than Screen Unlock. Only downside is Face unlock is image based.hence require sufficient light on face to recognize you. Also, you need to turn on screen to unlock, unlike IR based sensor in iPhone X or Huawei Mate 20.7. PUBG game looks gorgeous with HDR and Ultra frame rate settings. No lag or stuttering whatsoever. Game runs fast n smooth with great graphics.Cons: (not many)1. In display fingerprint sensor even though worlds fastest among In Display sensors in terms of unlocking speed, need more polishing. Not as fast as physical. But u will not know much difference if u r coming from OnePlus2. Unlocking bleeds bright light on sensor area might be annoying at night.2. No Headphone jack might be deal breaker for some. But they give type c to 3.5mm adapter in box. So shud not be as much as deal breaker. Pre-Order will fetch u a type c headphones for free.3. Nothing else which I can think of now.	5
Good look performance	4
No second opinion, the best phone ever	5
Just a little less handy considering the huge screen but worth every penny spent. Amazing speed and quality	5
I just bought this phone and loving it	4
Camera is not good	3
Awesome phone it is	5
As we all know, OnePlus had never disappointed it's customers. The only disappoint I had while buying this was, my OnePlus 6 was valued only for 9000. This shows how drastic the price of OnePlus can go down. Apart from this, the phone is completely similar to OnePlus 6 interns of build quality and performance. The due drop display has no special features. Just a apparel stuff. The fingerprint sensor in the front has both upside and downside. The upside is ease to use but the downside is, if your display breaks then you should be ready to pay a lot.	5
Night pictures need to improve more... Day pictures are amazing selfies and back camera both.. battery is amazing.  To check the sound quality waiting for my bullet headphones.	5
Nothing much to thing about. U wont get regretted after buying it.Pros:Pretty Cool Features and Specs.Camera looks stunning.Decent Battery lifeCons:U cant use headphones while charging	5
Purchased the One Plus 6T from Amazon yesterday.It's a great smartphone, a flagship killer. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:1) Great super AMOLED display, with high screen to aspect ratio and notch hiding option.2) Good camera with life like colours, with OIS/EIS making video shooting stable.3)Good battery life.4) Fast processor and an easy to use OS, with no unnecessary bloatware.5) Charging is fast and hassle free, like all One Plus phones.6) Fingerprint and face unlock is simultaneous, and reasonably fast.7) Absence of notification light is not missed, rather it's a blessing in disguise !Cons:1) Too heavy, fingers hurt after holding it for some time.2) Screen flash for the selfie camera takes lighted, but grainy photos in pitch darkness. The Vivo V11 Pro selfie camera also uses screen flash,but the photos are less grainy.3) Poor ring tone selection, you have to download ring tones.4) No in built FM radio.5) Good sound output, but mono non stereo sound coming from 1 speaker.6) Potrait mode / Bokeh effect snaps are just average, both for the front and rear cameras, background contrast is poor and uneven. The Vivo V11 Pro takes better potrait photos.7) Mirror black version and the plastic cover is prone to fingerprint smudges and attracts dust. It has to be wiped regularly with a cloth.As you can see however, the cons are nothing major, and overall,its a great value-for-money phone!	4
I just loved it.camera variations , pics quality, smooth operation, look n feel.. overall an awesome package	5
Very wrost product from one plus..my first experience with Amazon is very bad.ring volume is mute can't rise volume and one speaker is not working...	1
OnePlus you make great phones! I have bought and used every phone since OnePlus X !But it's kinda stupid to remove the headphone jack !And what did we get in return a slow fingerprint reader ?No IP rated Water resistance ? No wireless charging?Everyone's loves new features, but not at the cost of essential ones !	1
The picture quality, sound quality, overall performance and more that that it is so fast and smooth. I was a Samsung user. Now a big big fan of Oneplus ..6T is just awesome. Just hit it. Better worth the purchase. Simply amazing and perfect delivery by Amazon.	5
Superb sound and battery camera I am very excited about this phone I have gifted this to my wife in annuarsery and she is very excited	5
Excellent mobile	5
Best phone ever.. tag line is appt unlock the speed.. and you feel it's premium one	5
Amazing battery life and a great experience to use it. I would say this phone is one of the best phone in  industry till date at this price range.(6+128).	5
Everything is awesome	5
Battery life is not goodIt goes down too earlyIt makes trouble for me	3
All rounder	5
Impressive no doubts!!!! Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phoneAWESOME....#NeverSettle	5
I have always been a One Plus fan. It's worth upgrading from 3T to 6T. Just loved it. Speed is very fast and you will feel when you play games. Camera is too good. Battery backup goes for a day with net.Overall, it's really a beautiful beast from One Plus.	5
Excellent successor to one plus 6	5
Yes, it's NEVER SETTLE	5
Very pleased with the performance.- Works effectively in the low network signal.- Impressive picture quality.- Very fast face recognition algo.- Wifi receiver is also very good and able to catch weak ranges too.	5
Fully stratified with OnePlus 6t...Even though poco f1 is at 21k..I just bought OnePlus..Worth for the money paid..OnePlus always far ahead from competition..Good battery and improved camera..screen is top range..Overall I would strongly recommend..Thanks OP for your uncompromising quality products...	5
Can't tell anything because it's just awesome	5
Gorgeous display, superb software support, ultra smooth, close to stock experience. Can't expect any better.	5
Good phone	5
Pros:Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :Dcoming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.Ummm what else....Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!Cons:The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger  to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!If you have any questions,do ask!	5
My favourite phone	5
It's one the best smartphone I ever have used.Thank you Oneplus for this amazing phone and Amazon too for their services.	5
Value for money...Best smartphone brand..	5
Best mobile ever..	5
Awesome beast battery life,Smooth & fast (OS)JUST LOVE IT	5
Been 3 days using the phone and it is a gem. Specs are great. Fingerprint sensor slower than usual I feel but can't complain. In short for the price, it is the best phone out there! Will recommend without any hesitation.	5
If I try to find any issue, I will not find any. Its the best Android phone I have used upto till now.I have a iphone too,but since I received this One Plus 6t, iphone has just bcome a second phone for me.Great PerformanceGreat CameraGreat LooksGreat DisplaySimply Wow !!	5
First time buyer of One Plus and its awesome. Phone performance is good, very much liked the speed and camera.	5
Waiting for free headset	2
Awesome mobile	4
Battery backup is awesome. Delivery was done swiftly. Performance is too good. Fast charging is something they have already excelled in. In alln, I loved the phone. I am using an 8GB RAM, 256 GB model of one plus 6t.	5
This picture says it all why you have to choose this beast..	5
There are minor flaws here and there and I think it will be improved by Software Updates	4
Camera quality is best.new night mode is superb and smooth screen you feel classy touch experience after using this phone.	5
The fon is bulky and its gliding on almost al the surfaces, but not preferable to b used without a case	2
Product is superb, but I haven't received the offer to buy the bullet earphone which was showed before purchasing and buying Rs.1000.00 gift card. What is the status of the ear phone kindly tell?	4
Beats every other phone right now in terms of quality and reliabilityCon- Headphone jack.. Though you get the connector, it's kind of a irritating thingy to carry it everywhere you go	4
I really loved it!!!Good specs.Good performance.Faster speed.Better camera quality and very good night photography.Good battery life.No 3.5mm jack but no problem there is a Type-C to 3.5mm jack connector within the boxOverall it's a best smartphone.	5
Sound quality is best	4
Picture quality worst	1
Worth every pennyCamera changes, battery backup, processing speed - multitasking, inscreen fingerprint even better oneplus	5
Awesome product	5
The feel of the phone is awesome....One of the best flagship phones in the marketFully satisfied	5
This phone is best in class available till date. I have been using this devices from last 13 days, no issues observed as of now. Performance, battery, graphics and intelligent battery saver keeps your phone alive and makes the user experience remarkable. Talking about the camera, pictures are vibrant even in low light environment. Last but not the least, design is attractive. The build quality is superior. Even in case, phone looks superb. (And of course thin, its important for me atleast :-) ).	5
Okay	4
Just switched from Apple to this flagship one , but this simply amazing one , from speed to low light photography is awesome ....if you looking for a performer phone in decent price , go for this without any second thought .	5
Nice phone	5
If it's your first OnePlus, then go for it.	4
Very Disappointed With camera Results... I had using Google Nexus 6P (Huawei made) and it's a far far far better than OP 6T... It's just no comparison between OP 6T and NEXUS 6P...OTHERWISE the Phone has all The Killing Features...If Your First Priority is Camera then don't buy this phone... Very disappointing Results...	4
Very good phone....	5
Too good! Worth purchase!	5
Battery backup is very poor	2
Best phone ever !!!! Strongly recommend. No issues faced regarding on-screen fingerprint scanner.	5
Excellent display. The notch looks good. Doesn't bother much.	5
best mobile	5
Stunning phone fastestFab looks sound best in all	5
Vibrant display,decent look,excellent camera and battery backup,smooth performance.pnly cons are its not up rated and sterio sound.	4
Battery life and speed of this phone are amazing. Picture quality is also very good, but picture quality at night is the only drawback with this phone. They have added Nightvision to the camera which is awesome, but even with that the noise in other picture modes at night is a concern. Again, the speed is just mind blowing and screen qualiy is sweet.	5
Nice one	5
Good	5
Nice mobile	4
Wonderful Product and Recommending to use the same	5
ITS Really Faster Than One Plus 6 Too,Very Smooth And Efficient,Under Display Scanner Is Also Quick And The Display Is Really Pretty,One Thing Is For Sure Youll Never Regret Buying A Oneplus Device 	5
Glamorous look, osssmmm camera, good battery back-up,	5
Comparing to 6,6T does it  better The best of best The build quality in every spects it's amazing Definitely u should go n purchase this new one 	5
So far so good . Loving this	5
Excellent	5
Not disappointed at all..finger print is only a bit issue.. everything else is excellent	5
Truly the best one plus phone and although slightly overpriced but i feel satisfied using it. Almost all the features once would expect from a flagship.	4
Awesome	4
Just go for it guys.. best phone in dis range	5
With the latest update which I received yesterday. Battery life is simply superb. Nightscape is superb	5
This is the beast ,very very much awesome and it's design and the whole body why one thing whole phone is awesome... Also so fast delivery... I got it in 2 days with my watch which I order 1 day later after phone but I got both together... I got watch within 24 hours... So fast man...And this phone is beauty.. I recommend it to you...	5
Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone.	5
Best phone!!!	5
Love you Amazon and Love You OnePlus...  Superb .. Awesome... Excellent... Overall proud and happy with Amazon teaming up with OnePlus..	5
Wow what a great phone everything is awsome	5
There is no notification led... I really don't like the animation in the finger print censor. Expected slimmer phone . But one plus 6t feels heavy !!!	3
I prebooked this phone from different id which I couldn't access again. Now my gift voucher is in my email and I couldn't use it during I bought this item. I need those earphones and I can share the Amazon gift code email screenshot. Please let me have those earphones. I bought this phone for pubg and pubg is impossible without earphones.	5
Blindly go for it	5
Pros:*Large 3700 mAh Battery for 8+ Hours of Screen on time*Large 6.41 Inch OLED Display which is Crisp and awesome with the best in class Sunlight Visibility*Dual Camera with Portrait Mode, Nights cape, Studio Lighting,*Android Pie with plenty of features, like Gaming mode, Reading mode, Slider etc*Dash Charge which give you quick charge of full phone within a few hours*Very Thin Bezels give you a premium look*Worlds Fastest In display Fingerprint scanner works like charm..*Buy it with the Instant Discount and cashback and free type c earphones at just Rs.33,500 Only (2000 Instant Disc, 1000 Cashback, 1490 Type C Earphones)*128 gb Storage for the base variant with 6Gb Ram this is the best.ConsNo Headphone jack and Notification LED.	4
Awesome product , Awesome Price.	5
One plus 6T is the best product..... I am loyal customer of one plus ... Before I was using one plus one .... Now I have updated to one +6T and it's really awesome...... It's competition to Apple X and Google pixel.... suddenly Apple has started to launch X series r and s....	5
After 2 years am using Android phone... selected best phone value for money 	5
I havent received the earphones as promised on pre order. Kindly revert on the same.	5
Good phone, good camera, good battery, fast for any games with awesome clarity for any android phone today. Love navigation gestures. awesome pictures with Night Mode on.Mirror black feels slippery in hands tough.	5
Don't think just buy	5
Battery life is bad	3
I was just shifted from OnePlus one to 1+6t ... It's full on beast mode..Every segment of this phone was an A+..I was truly satisfied with what I got..	5
Awesome mobile but only guilty feeling is I didn't wait for the new purple colour limited edition .just feeling bad for that other than that everything is perfect about the phone	5
I have recently bought OnePlus6T and have been using the phone from past few days. Here is my feedback on the phone:Pros:i. Android Pie is smooth in its functionality. The upgrades are definitely adding further improvement to the UI.ii. Camera is the best you can find in any phone. Low light photography is amazing. Front portrait pics are clean and decent. The quality of the photos are incredible and unbeatable with any other phone of the same price range.iii. Battery backup is unbelievable. One time full charge is approximately carrying for 9 hours which includes heavy gaming like PUBG.iv. Snapdragon processor is very fast. Under heavy graphics  HD mode, PUBG is smooth in its gameplay with hardly any lag.v. Dual sim VOLTE support is yet another added advantage with smart wifi switching option.vi. Sound is very high and crystal clear. The speaker is very powerful and mic is also very sensitive.Cons:i. The edges of the phone which are having place for menu, back button are little difficult to access with the case cover (Minimal problem but can be adjusted with)ii. Slight lag in the indisplay finger print sensor (taking little longer than expected) yet fast enough not to lag your work.iii. Ambient display brightness is sometimes unable to adjust in sunlight which may be stressful to the eyesOverall verdict is that the phone is a true definition for a flagship killer.NOTE: I was using Oneplus 3 earlier and my pros and cons are based on the comparision of my previous experiences	5
Somehow not as defined as I expected this phone to be. The SW is patchy and some apps are not integrated well enough like true caller. The camera is a big setback for me and I don't see the same quality as one plus 5. Night pics are a disaster. Maybe the next set of updates might improve the experience. Overall an average product. Expected much better.	3
Pleasantly surprised with the buld quality (glasses). Very smooth to operate. Android pie is a gift to use... Rear camera quality is average in indoor shoots. But selfies are impressive.	5
Superb product. Change apple to one plus 6t.	5
Excellent Product and it delivered in 48 hours.	5
Crazy for oneplus 6t	5
Great phone with good software, camera and battery. Dash charging is fast. It will take only 1 hour 15 mins to full charge	5
Simply awesome.... performance packed phone.. battery backup is very good compared OnePlus 6...fingerprint on screen works flawlessly..	5
Good	5
Upgraded from OnePlus 5T1. Battery Life Has Improved a lot thanks for the upgrade OnePlus.2. Camera Quality has improved, I was missing the OIS but now nothing to Worry.3. The Water Droplet Notch is not a Hindrance at all. The display quality is what one should be.4. After the last Update the Screen Unlock Has become Even Faster. I really don't find a difference in the speed between the Physical Finger print scanner and this Indisplay one. It's equally Fast.5. The Speaker even after being a Mono Gives Really Good Listening experience.6. OVER ALL A MUST BUY / UPGRADE.	5
Just awesome.Thankyou oneplus	5
moved from iphone and I'm not disappoined... amazing phone..superb camera quality...sound quality.. overall nice product	5
I like everything in this phone except camera picture quality specially in night when I use flash I can sell white thing like smoke in the picture. I called Amazon let's see what they'll do	3
Good	5
It's simple superb	5
I'm using one plus products for last three years, they are best in performance, value for money products, screen unlock fingerprint feature is fast, night mode is also good. Picture took at 9 pm with night mode feature.....	5
Need some more	4
Upgraded from 6 to 6tMy one line review - " I will pick 6 anytime over 6t"Some Important Points :On Screen fingerprint sensor is fast but of course not that past as physical fingerprint sensorCamera there is no change except the so called NIGHTSCAPE and if you are expecting it to be like one in pixel let me tell you that is a complete noAlgorithms of both the phones are different for low light photos and one used in one plus is bit shaggy .It basically illuminates the light sources present in the photo and spread it evenly over the entire clickScreen is good , notch is better than that old notchBattery is average , though they have increased the capacity but i dont see major differences in screen on time . Dash charge though is the best thing about one plusOverall Review : A power packed phone with good build and performance but now doesnt look like a flagship nor even a flagship killer	4
Nice	5
This is my 2nd phone of One Plus, previously used 5T. Honestly, I am very impressed with this phone as there is no problem in last 8 days.Everything is superb.	5
Omg this phone is really awesome I m planning to buy the iPhone Xs but my friend is using the OnePlus 6 phone so we decided to go to Apple store and compare OnePlus 6 and iPhone Xs and atlast I m shocked when I see the difference is almost nothing I am really happy with this OnePlus 6t thanks a lot Amazon and offcourse OnePlus company for this cheap and best phone and most for the quality they provide in the very cheap price thanks a lot OnePlus phone worth the money	5
Unlocked the speed , Great experience Awesome phone .it's worth Thanks :)	5
Good amoled screen, improved camera is the best feature i liked	5
It's looking good,. Battery back up superb. It's always one plus rock killer	5
As a student, one can get all the essential speeds and performance through this mobile. This was simply stunning, the OxygenOS makes it more special. The gestures and the whole customizations are amazing. Camera quality can be improved further when compared to other mobiles at this price. Also don't feel that there is no 3.5 mm jack, my opinions are1) Firstly a person spending around 38k for a mobile shouldn't complain about cheap jack. Industries always try to improve technology even their customers don't like them. This is the reason why big companies like apple & Huawei also following this, now it's OnePlus turn.2) with the more enhancement in the battery segment as well as that superb speed industry fastest screen unlock facility did not give enough room for the audio jack facility, Don't think that they removed the jack because to sell their earphones. In my opinion, one plus never does such kind of a cheap stuff.The 6.41 inches AMOLED screen is extraordinary, so many vibrant colours with such a huge screen to body ratio and the water droplet notch looks too cute, even you can disable through software.even with the increased battery size, they have improved the same charging time with one plus 6, a great move.when you have such an amazing dash speed charger, some people still complain about wireless charging & it is such a piece of slow work, I dunno why people crave for that slow speed charging and they don't realize that the wireless charger adapter even should be connected to board through wire, instead here connect the mobile directly and get super speed.finally, the mobile is water resistant only, don't get feared when you have a situation with water. there are several water tests on youtube and watch them you can understand that it is resistive even after 20 minutes. They simply don't want to waste the money for official certification of so-called IP rating, so never mind, they are thinking for our benefit only.The Build quality is of premium class and with NO hesitations 1 can choose 1+ with safehands.	5
Pic quality ,sound quality,battery life shud be improve	4
Its amazing.Note:dont worry about in display fingerprint ,its quite fast.just go 4 it and unlock the speed	5
It is the best cell phone ever.....	5
Excellent sound quality and picture quality..Touch works superb and nice resolution..  life was wonderful ..it's been 5 hours after charging only 5% got drained. Gud speed without any hanging..Just go for it..Worst Amazon delivery!!!	5
I like it	5
It's good as like old lunches oneplus again produced flagships killer.	5
The OnePlus 6T is superbly great, well crafted, extremely powerful, and fully capable of doing what most people want their phones to do beyond imagination. When compared to other phones at its own price level, the camera performance on the OnePlus 6T is farther better than other phones. Everything is at its peak best.The beast in half of Xsmax price wd a waterdrop notch along wd edge cut superbly magnificient.Cons:Only thing is the battery could be more powerful#Thankyou Oneplus	5
It's a great handset i never seen this much quality handset before in android mobiles.Superb design by 1+..I like the in-display unlocking options.Sound quality awesome.Camera superb.Display looks great	5
This phone needs no comments just a 5phone	5
Nice stylish look, Good quality sound, good on screen finger sensor ... Over all very happy with the quality u get in that price range. So value for money as compared with all other options u get in android as One plus is the only one phone I found with out any flaws I can report. Was using One plus 3 earlier no complaints for that too ... :)	5
Waited along time to buy this OnePlus..and the wait was worth it	5
Notification led nod available 	5
It's really awesome phone, very fast, and camera even take unbelievable picture in dark also , I m not expecting that it will take pic like this in dark night but when I get I test that first.It is Handy phone and light weight with amazing features.I think u can go for that it's better than iPhone in camera quality in deam light.Easy to use	5
Excellent mobile with excellent features worthy one to purchase ,	5
Excellent	5
Best phone...Excellent qualityLoved it....	5
OnePlus never fails to amaze. It is a solid phone for the price. The included case is great as well and quite protective for my needs. I don't miss the headphone jack at all, using Bluetooth headphones is more convenient and unless you're an audiophile you can't notice the difference in sound quality. The battery is a beast and the performance is amazing.	5
Simply Amazing	5
Best thing in terms of mobile phones to ever occur in my life. Love it	5
It's very good in all the aspects. Camera is very good. Best phone till now...	5
Why do I get this error once a day I have to restart only then I am able to make calls.	4

It's just good. Nothing exceptional. My previous phone was a Galaxy S6, I can still say with certainty there are many aspects in that phone far superior to this. It's an ok phone,nothing huge	3
Awesome phone with great battery life and camera, with better design too.	5
Good phone	5
One of the best phone i ever buy, excellent performance.	5
Awesome phone	5
Extremely smooth to use and unbelievable speed. Worth the wait and the money. Beautiful display, sound quality, screen, camera. Face unlock so fast that it surprises me. Go for it people!	5
Only one of the speakers is working. Is that a software tweak?	4
Loved it. If you're in doubt, then don't be. If it is in your budget then don't think twice, just go for it.	5
Really a flagship killer with this price. This is the shoot of evening time as you can see that the quality of picture is awesome. Build quality is good. Camera is superb and battery life is also works for whole day in heavy usage. Superb performance, gaming mode is superb option for gamers.	5
Best mobile under 40kcamera, display, water drop notch, on screen finger print are awesome	4
BEST PHONE UNDER 40K* NOTCH IS TINY & CUTE *IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT IS FAST. PLEASE DONT BELEIVE RUMORS THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO GET USE TO..*CAMERA IS GOOD NO COMPLAINTS ( GCAM PORTED FOR 6T) SO WE ARE READY TO ROCK*BATTERY LAST A DAY ( WHO CARES ABOUT BATTERY WHEN DASH CHARGE IS AVAILABLE )*NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT DISPLAY ITS AMOLED  (NO SCREEN BLEED ISSUE )*IMPROVED OXYGEN OS THIS TIME MORE POLISHED & MORE FLUID. GESTURE CONTROL IS NOW NEGATIVES :* ONLY ONE SPEAKER  WHILE PLAYING GAME IT GETTING BLOCKED EASILY*NO 3.5 JACK.. I KNOW FUTURE WILL GO WIRELESS. BUT WE ARE NOT READY SO SURELY WE WILL MISS THE AUDIO JACK 	5
Size: 8+128 GBColour: Mirror BlackPhone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone is good	5
Let's begin with pros1. Good build quality.2. Great camera and specs.3. Battery life is good.Cons:-1. Expected stereo speakers.2. Indisplay fingerprint is fast but not accurate.3. No headphone jack.	5
Video and picture quality is very bad quality	5
Awesome product in this range. Camera quality is to good	5
This is my dream phone. It had awesome battery life. Sound quality is unbelievable and now I don't need to carry heavy DSLR with me because camera result is superb	5
Best in quality for sound, battery life and picture.Value for money	5
Ultimate PerformanceUltimate Smart PhoneUltimate Oneplus	5
A Perfect Value for money phone.128GB ROM and 8GB RAM and a Superfast OS and a Butter smooth User Interface!What more do you want? Amazon delivered it in 2days to me. I am super happy with this device!The phone gives you a premium feel when you hold it. I was an apple fan. But Oneplus rules my heart now.3.5mm Headphone Jack missing but they have also provided the Dongle along. You can't really complain because instead, now they have increased the battery.	5
Pros: 1.Processor 2.Ergonomics 3.Camera and Night scape mode 4.Superb battery life 5.Value for money guaranteedCons: Sometimes Inbuilt fingerprint is slow.	5
Hey Fellas , been using this phone almost 10days now. The only word I can describe this phone is "perfection". It has everything in it a good battery life (depends on usage of app's) and the camera. Just in love with the quality of image's are captured. Very vervhappy with the product.	5
Best phone ever	5
Being an Iphone user i can say Iphone's camera is much better than OnePlus's camera. Very good battery backup. Faced few glitches like double tap wake up sometimes doesn't reponds. In-Display finger print scanner takes ages to unlock sometimes.	4
Really a very nice mobile	5
1. Picture quality zero third class2. Heat while charging3 heat issue while playing game like pubg4. Slipry grip5. Heavy weight6. Camera in night also wrost7. When you zoom picture taken by 6t shows the blur images and red eyes8. There lack of A. I  artificial intelligence9. Face lock security is totaly unsafe i tried open with my passport size foto & opend screen lock10. Battery life is good fast charging but heating issue also11. No headfone jack you have to manage with charging jack adapter of headfoneI return after using 2 days & thanks to amazone to refund on time and saves my money by return /  refund policy	1
I would refer OnePlus 6t over any other device any time!!	5
Picture quality is excellent, and phone also is very good. But phone size is large.	5
I like the phone very much. Messages option is very nice. Sending all notifications under one category. But it would be better you should have provided FM(Radio) default app also. Also all the pics if displayed at one place will be easier. Now we have to go to collections and search if we require any pic that was sent from friends.I didn't understand how the second camera works. If there is no option of changing camera, what is the use of giving 2 cameras backside?	4
Smartest, fastest, cleanest, lovable mobile. I have purchased midnight black colour. I strongly recommend to purchase.	5
A very good phone with a budget price	5
Stunning product from OnePlus. Best in class. Dashing look. Superb camera. Amazing sound. Eye catching display. Best In Display Fingerprint Scanner till date. Superfast delivery from amazon within 36 hours. OnePlus proves itself again. NEVER SETTLE	5
Very easy to transfer my oneplus 3 data	5
Picture quality: superbSound quality: superbBattery life: easily getting 2 days life without charging again.Fast charging in 45 minutes full charge	5
Picture quality is good. But night scape takes some time for processing. Battery life is super. You will easily get 1 full day. In display finger print is slow sometimes.	5
Good Android mobile	5
Hey everyone.pros: In brief 6T is OnePlus 6 + IDF + extended battery+Tear drop.Cons:1. It is not that much handy as OP6 was. It does not fit good in hand.2. Still no stereo speakers added. Even after removing 3.5 mm jack.3. No IP rating mentioned by the company.4. Bulkier and even thicker than OP6 .	4
Best battery backupGood screen to body ratio.Decent camera. Wish the camera was better.Snappy phone	5
I love it	5
Awesome	5
When you unbox the product, first thing you notice is design. And when i opened that box , omg wowwww design and color. Phone is running so smooth, and that water drop notch looks good and mobile was very light, all i can say must buy phone.	5
Hello,Now I've been using this beast since few days, this phone is a beast there are no complains against anything about this phone.Battery is perfect around 8-9 hours of onscreen time recharges quick as promised.Cameras are awesome no doubt about that.OS and UI are very smooth and easy to use.There are some issues which are to be looked after:1. The inbuilt fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't work quickly, I have to place my thumb 1-2 times in different position to get it work.2. Again the fingerprint sensor at night time when all lights are off and when you unlock ur phone with fingerprint sensor the screen brighten ups to it's fullest (like it's stealing my eyesight  )3. The night scape mode in camera it processes too long which is embarrassing when I'm showing off this features to friends4. The most important thing this is not actually an issue, but just a suggestion - I really miss the notification LED light, because every time I've to pick up the phone to check wether I have a notification or not or for what my phone had buzzed.There's a app called as NO LED available on play store which uses some pixels to color up and  show up in the lock screen but it's annoying I'm sure OnePlus can definitely come with a better app or solution.I'm sure this issues can easily resolved by the company in a software update.Thanks for reading.Overall it's the best phone for this budget range go for it and buy it.Update : finger print issue is resolved it's now quick	5
picture quality is just awesome .. sound and battery is too good ! value for money ... OnePlus 6T !! being a iphone user I must say oneplus 6t is much better den iPhone !!	5
Excellent product. A must have mobile.	5
Almost everything is quit good in this range, just missing headphone jack.	5
Fast and excellent	5
Amazing phone loved it	5
Phone is good but without a head phones difficult to manage as headphones are yet to be delivered .Finger touch is not at all better than previous versions however face recognition is good . Decent phone but not a must buy for everyone . One can buy other pho rs at lesser price	3
Awesome phone ..Thank you Amazon for early deliveryI got the phone just after 2 days of ordering..Really impressed by the color..Great speed..Charging is superfast like the OnePlus claimed to beThe device gives a great feel or comfort in you handVery convenient to hold and useSound quality is god, but could have been better with dual speaker on both the sides of the phoneAt the end this is a great pakage at this price ...	5
Nice	5
Amazing superNice one products andExcellent workingThanks Amazon andCompany	5
This phone is perfect.OS is amazing.Camera is perfect.Sound quality wity stereo speakers or dual speakers it's amazing.Removal of headphone jack sometimes is a struggle.	5
Good	5
After using OnePlus 3T, 5T and OP6, OP6T is as expected. Great Product. Camera is better than OP6 even though having same camera as OP6	5
I had prebooked the phone but didn't get the earphones, are they coming in later or something?	5
Good Phone But Not Great	3
One of the best phones I have used till date, you will not regret buying it.Let's talk about the pros first:Clean UI and blazing speed:Speed and clean UI is the best in class when comes to OnePlus devices, one of the best UI I have used till now. Performance is only next to iPhone xs max and mate 20 pro, however these devices are much costlier than 6tDisplay:It's fricking good , one of the best full HD display in this rangeIn display finger print scanner:Guys, this is so so good, it's very fast, not lagging as mentioned in other reviewsBattery:Again a department where OnePlus 6t takes a big leap. I have been using poco F1 with 4000 mih battery, but 6t with 3700 mih lasts longer than poco F1.Camera:Camera is better than poco F1, however the night mode of 6t cannot be compared with pixel 3( you can take a shot in pitch dark), this is where OnePlus has to improve if it wants to become real flagship rather than being `flagship killer`.  However I am happy with camera performance considering the price point.Cons:None - it would be unfair to mention anything in cons as I don't find any.Final verdict: OnePlus has put in their heart and soul in making 6t .	5
Best oneplus product unbeatable features 	5
A big fan of oneplus. This is so far the best from oneplus. The stock android and with oxygen OS makes your phone experience as smooth as it can ever be. The camera is very decent. The nightscape mode is okay, i miss the pro mode that was better but its okay. For gaming purposes this phone is a monster. Pubg or asphalt there is no lag. You will forget what does the word hanging means. The face unlock is super accurate even works in night.Just buy it. Battery lasts all most 2 days.	5
My new one plus 6t is stucking a lot. Screen getting blank every time it get stucked. It stucked 5 times in last two days. Requesting you to please replace my phone.	1
Good	5
Awesome phone .. worth an upgrade from 2 plus old flagships	5
This thing is insanely fast and honestly speaking buy it without any second thought.Gaming experience is super awesome,photos are good and video quality is top notch,audio is very clear and loud from phone speaker.	5
Phone is really good. But sometimes it gives me feel as if I am using Motorola Phone. But lookwise it's awesome. Overall good experience with OnePlus	5
Beast of a phone with good battery, in-display finger print, beautiful design but lacks on a few of the latest features like IP68 dust and water proof and no wireless charging.But yeah there's a price for everything.Overall very happy with the purchase.	4
Very much impressed with the performance.But expected a bit more battery life.Overall awesome performance	5
Picture quality is good. But not the best!! Also the loudspeaker is very loud and the quality is awesome. But, sadly it doesn't sport stereo speakers. If it would be stereo, then the sound quality might be unbeatable. The battery life is good enough!!	5
I had 3 doubts before buying1. Speakers - they are loud enough almost as per many dual speaker phones2. Notch - this phone hides the notch pretty well.3. Headphone jack - easily survived 4 days with the adapter always fixed to my headphone wire. Now I don't even remember what headphone jack was. Also, adapter are available at very cheap rates everywhere.Phone is superb & please do not conpare it with poco. Oxygen OS is far superior.	5
Great phone, nice features set just as one plus 6.But having used oneplus 6 for a couple of months before buying this I would say that after a few days of using this the novelty has worn off, meaning that the basic difference between two phones which is of finger scanner is not a big deal after a few days into usage.Other than that the phone is rock solid,, better battery, don't miss the headphone jack, notch is smaller phone more heftier (good).A brilliantly packaged phone none the less.	5
Good but price to high	4
I LOVE ONEPLUS PHONES BUT I HAD RECEIVED A OENPLUS 6T DEVICE WITH A SCRATCH ON THE SCREEN PROTECTOR WHERE THE FINGER PRINT SCANER IS PLACED.. ITS NOT GOOD ONEPLUS ...TOTAL DISPOINTMENT..DONT KNW IF THEY REPACK THE PHONE ....PLEASE NOTE THAT AMEZON AND ONE PLUS	4
When I received the phone it was  showing mute status. I am unable to unmute it. I tried several methods but it doesn't allow. I can increase the media and alarm volume but not the ring. Since the time I received it, it's on mute. I am sharing the screen shot.	1
Really loved the gestures but phone is very heavy	5
Fingerprint sensor is awesome. Totally in love with oneplus6T	5
Superb phone	5
Best decision if you really want to go for phone. In terms of camera 5/5 , sound 5/5, battery full day . But when you talk about dash charging half n hour that is the thing which is not true, it took 1.5 hours to charge fully. But that was not a issue. People should go for this phone.	5
The One Plus 6T is amazing . Everything is just amazing than iPhone . Speed is great .But the people having one plus 6 there is no need to upgrade now .	5
Awesome 	5
Awesome	5
Just one word....AWESOME, this one is flagship killer in every sense.	5
The phone is ultra fast with all features intact and yes its meets the expectation always.Oneplus has made again an awesome phone..well pleased with the phone i recieved .Dont think about it much buy it.	5
Amazing phone. Must buy for the price.	5
Excellent product	5
Very nice mobile	5
Everything of dis phone is more then perfect for its price range be it camera, battery life, display ,OS. YES Its the true King of speed it just breezes through everyday tasks nd some heavy media usage.	5
Every thing is awsome	5
I am going with  4 out of 5 star. Everything is Just perfect about this beast except for the battery. Battery is a big disappointment. It drains quickly.	4
Good picture quality,good camera clicks, loud sound(average), battery life is good not very good. But worth a flagship killer.	5
Beast.Simply powerful enough.	5
Best mobile in all format and Amazon service very fast	5
Just go for it.... It's worth every penny invested to it.. and if you are having a OnePlus 6 then don't upgrade it.	5
I feel this phone is better than apple iphone series as it is cost effective and the best in the market in term of its features also. Thank you one plus for this amazing expierence. :)	5
My mobile is getting too hot during playing games	2
Everything's good except bottom firing mono speaker 	4
Picture quality is good. Performance is good.	5
Loved everything about it and nothing to complain about it	5
I was using OnePlus 3t for the past two years...3t was a excellent one..so want to go for the new one and bought 6t..Pro:1.Battery is reasonably good.2.No lags3.Almost stock android experience..4.As usual fast and smooth..5.available with back cover and scratch guard..so no need to spend extra6.looks premiumCons1.Removal of conventional headphone jack..remember it is not completely removed but can be used via converter2.display seems to be very dull..I don't know why but may be due to battery saving technique ..3.no led notification4.one handed operation is difficult ..5.camera is big let down..with all the hype I thought the camera is going to be good but it's not .very worst..don't even think about comparing the pictures of iPhone , s9+ and pixel with this one..	4
Phone totele good parfamnce but battery pekap not good	4
looking awsm,superb speed nd cool pics..lv u oneplus	5
Correctly priced	5
One speaker of the phone is not working what should I do.	3
I PLAYED ABOUT 12 GAMES IN CLASSIC MODE IN ONE PLUS 6T & STILL LEFT WITH ABOUT 25% BATTERY.FOR BEST RESULTS DO NOT PLAY GAME WHILE CHARGING.SORRY IOS THIS TIME U LOST THE GAME. COME BACK WITH A BOOMKINDLY ADD SCREEN RECORDING IN IT ...  MISSING PARTTHANK YOU <3	5
Camera quality is excellentOn screen finger print sensor is too goodGaming experience very smooth on phoneAudio quality too goodBattery life excellent	5
All features are good & smart look	5
I purchased a 6GB, 128GB phone. I m using the dual camera lens for the first time and noticed some objects getting out of focus in the auto mode. Sound quality is same as before with very little improvement. However, OLED display is certainly good with natural colors. The phone came with pre attached screen guard which absorbs lot of prints requiring frequent cleaning. In screen fingerprint sensor works fine. I have always bought one plus as their phones are fast and don't lag like Samsung/Iphone	5
I actually like the notch. camera Quality, Fingerprint sensor,	5
This is the best	5
There is no 3.5 mm jack. But when you will use this phone, definitely you'll forget about that... This phone is just awesome.	5
No 1mobile	2
You will be amazed by what this device can do.Most of my friends says it has better camera than iPhone X.I had an iPhone for 3 years and now made a move to this. iPhone is having it's own issues ie battery and ram management and all.	5
One word to say its awesome.	5
Good battery life, nice camera, fast in-display finger print, easy multi tasking...	4
This is a real flagship device...U will truly like it...it's really the most fastest......NOT MORE TO SAY..U KNOW ITS ONE PLUS(FEEL THE POWER)	5
Good one but feeling like cost is bit higher.	5
It is really a awesome product made by OnePlus	5
Finger print takes too long to recognize & feel uncomfortable. Otherwise good.	4
Earphones are missing I didnt received my earphones	5
Excellent product	5
Phone is superbI purchase 6+128gbIt play like liquidIt mean smooth performanceGo for it blindlyBy regular use of game internet youtube n song. It gives a day performance battery even at midnight there is still 22% pending battery.Battery performance is good too and fingerprint is like wow yaar.it feel wow 	5
Finish of this piece is excellent. It is at power to pixel and iPhone. picture quality is flawless. phone speaker can be improved. It is lound and clear ,but does have sharpness at high volume	5
Perfect smartphone	5
Prompt delivery as promised and quality product	5
there was a headphone offer for oneplus 6t for the people who per order and  and buy before 3 nov they as informed that inn15 nov will get there headphone voucher any updates on this when and how it will get	5
	5
As expected, no department of cons. Only pros... Best handset of the planet	5
Worth of money	5
I was disappointed that 256G variant was out of stock and I had to settle for 128G model. There could have been a book model not available which could have extended the offer which was otherwise expiring on Nov-03 2018.	5
The mobile is just awesome in terms of everything. And If u r upgrading from one plus 5t and lower version of mobiles then I would say worth upgrading as I was using One plus 5 previously and this gave me a wonderful satisfaction....Negative about OP6t is No headphone jack, etither u can use headphones or u can charge the mobile at the same time. And notification light is not there , you will not get to know until u on the screen .....so over all I can say the mobile is worth for money .....	5
Upgraded from OP5. Could observe huge difference. Battery life is better, Display is huge, camera quality in day time cannot be questioned. But in low light and portrait mode some of the under 20k phones gave a better picture.	5
I'm writing this after a complete one day use. First of all mobile looks very premium in hands. AMOLED display with notch is quite awesome. Sound output quality and call quality is good. Battery life for minimal users will be 1 and Half to 2 days. For users who browse and play games will be one day. 0-70% quick charge will happen in first 30-35 minutes and overall it takes 55mins to an hour time for full battery. An immediate security patch for better enhancements will be available. Camera quality is good pictures are coming out like awesome in all the modes. Upgraded from OnePlus 3 after two years of usage to 6t. Bought mobile for 25744 after exchange and other discounts. Phone is good at speed. Ram optimization is nice. Total available space will get is 113 GB out 128GB. You have OTG support. The Oxygen OS is terrific with customization. Will be having a default applied screen protector and also back case which is good available in box. One thing which I have noticed is the download speed from Jio SIM is bit slow for first 3 to 5 hours. After that don't know it picked up really well. Go for this phone when you need all the features at a minimum cost with premium feel.Will let you know more after usage.	4
Another great phone from op. Excels in all categories.	5
Nights photos are simply awesome. Fingerprint sensor is working fine.	5
Flagship killer wonderful phone..Good battery life and camera.. Premium build quality..Smooth and easy to use..Sound quality simply superb..Indisplay fingerprint is excellent as it works very well. Thanks to amazon for the huge offers and cashbacks as well as one day delivery. Got this phone for 34k+	5
If yuh are a Iphone user please stay away.,Yull definetely nt like it	1
Awesome like always	5
Ok	2
Headphone Jack miss u.. A big drawback from One Plus..Even They larger battery 500 mah. 3200 to 3700 but still battery backup is not so good.. it was better earlier.. i sold my one plus 6. If u have one plus 6 then u don't go for 6t if u have another phone u must buy one plus 6t	4
It's an amazing phone and I love my phone. #thanksoneplus#thanksamazon.	5
Value of the money	5
It's very good phone and quick delivery	5
I like it very muchBuild quality awesomeAmoled Display Excellent battery lifeOverall good performanceIf u have any old device want to upgradeCan go for it blindly.	5
Able to make phone calls, read messages and install other apps easily. Able to play games like PubG and able to switch between apps without lag or heating. Hope thats how premium phone works. Good camera with night feature need to explored during festival times.  Other things as described.  Good OS looks new until new version comes in next six months. Let down for me was removing traditional 3.5 mm jack. Converter for headphone will be lost soon if I keep using it during travel. Waiting for free earphone from OnePlus since I pre-ordered.	5
This is my 1st oneplus device. Phone is killer.No cons except Fingerprint sensor accuracy and speed. Sometimes I got the same error as 'not recognized'.Otherwise device is a beast.Camera is awesome but need some works on optimization.Smooth processing and touch feel also very impressive.	4
Would have given 5 stars, if There was a dual speaker feature.Night shots are not so brilliant and inbuilt finger print scanner is little slow, compared to regular finger print scanner of oneplus product. Overall I'd like it rate is as 4	4
goid	5
Nice	5
The fingerprint sensor take extra time to unlock the device	4
Weight and thickness	4
After using Moto Z play for 2 years,now I am a proud owner of this great mobile 6t.One of the greatest phone I ever used......	5
Just awesome. Thank OnePlus & Amazon.	5
I like it's qualityValue of money phone	5
Value for money product, nice display n sound. Camera needs more improvements.	5
below expectations	3
The proct is good, display is awesome, but the sound quality could be better,	5
I receive one plus 6t but GST no. not mention in invoicepl check and give me any contact no. from I will ask this...	5
The phone looks very beautiful and has a very cool design. Camera quality is really good and the interface is very interactive.	5
Absolutely stunning performance # sexy screen display awesome I loved it.	5
The oneplus 6t is the flagship killer really and having the latest technology latest GPU the latest CPU and the latest display display quality is good and the in screen fingerprint scanner is also very accurate and also the face scanner is also accurate talking of the prices I have bought the oneplus 6t 8GB RAM 128 GB storage by the way I was using S7 Edge before I bought the oneplus 6t and I am not really missing the S7 edge because the camera like S7 edge screen like S7 edge install in it and the latest Android version of course so recommended buy it!!! One plus 6T is extremely best mobile .I love one plus.I always appreciate amoz service.In amoz time and date is extremely good for any products diliverly.I love amoz.Thanks amoz and one plus 6t also.	5
Battery life amazing..Picture quality.. especially the night shots . On the pointSound quality speaker is again not bad.I have upgraded from Mi to one plus ... To be honest I was an iPhone but . Damn this phone though. Speed ram management is perfect..	5
Only drawback is finger senser is not fast	4
Speaker should have been dual	5
This will blow your mind	5
The phone is a good phone with excellent battery speed and storage.Finger print is good although during night it emits a fair amount of light which is bright.	5
Nice Phone....But missed the LED for notifications.Good Camera, Good Processor, Amazing Display... Good Speed.	5
Just 10 days since i have bought this product . it hangs frequently	1
Large battery with power efficient and top of the line Processor.Price/Performance - 9/10Picture Quality - 8/10Battery life - 9/10	5
No memory card option. Otherwise Perfect & Awesome.	5
I was using Samsung S9+ for last few months and after using this since last few days i can say that oneplus 6t experience is really good and better than Samsung in many ways be it new gestures or things like fingerprint sensor which is in screen so very convenient to use and snappy performance so in my view this is the best phone under 50K.	5
Amazing hardware. Excellent camera in low light. But portrait mode is a disappointment. Battery life is best among all the phones when playing games.	4
I didnt get the coupne code of my ear phone. What will i do	5
Delivery speed is f*****ng good . Got delivered in just one day to almost to a remote village. Thanks Amazon. Coming to phone a big thumps up to the one plus. Liked it in all aspects. Loving it	5
Best phone	5
The new Oneplus Avtar will certainly satisfy those users who can compromise with the loss of 3.5 headphone jack and  notification led. The usb C- headphone jack adapter is in noway an alternative. Similarly, people will expect a stereo speaker on a phone of this price range -- even Asus Zenfone 5Z provides it at a much lower cost. Yes, 6t offers a lot of excellent features: its superb display, flagship hardware, software, excellent performance, great camera and, to some extent, good battery life, but the loss of some useful feature will deter many potential buyers accustomed with headphones and notification light.	4
I was considering pixel 3xl, but believe me this is way more better than half a pixel 3xl(may be even better than a full one ..lol). This phone is super practical and is a real companion in your day to day tasks. The gestures are beautiful. RAM is so much that I guess whole OS would fit in making everything just spontaneous. Zero lag in any thing. The draw V to start torch is super handy. Camera might not be like pixel 3xl, but for a person who takes normal amount of photos, it is more than sufficient. You won't be unhappy at all with camera.It comes with screen protector preapplied. A very good case.No headphones - not a big deal(u probably will buy your own at some stage)Fingerprint sensor is like just a little bit under 1 second. But it won't make your life slow at all.If you can afford it and want an upgrade, buy it, period	5
Good	5
Just buy it.	5
Just the phone one needs. Camera is jus on point! 	5
It's really a premium smart phone with all the latest features you could ever ask for. Camera quality is superb, especially night mode.Photos was taken in full dark night.Just one word. Best	5
I have an amazing experience using this phone for now 3 days. I am very satisfied with this product of 1+. Hope to find it better along the time	5
This is what a smart Generation Smartphone is called The ONEPLUS 6T.Just buy this one you will definitely forget your apple.	5
Excellent mobile with good camera features, smooth to handle with 8gigs ram. Asusuall best build quality by OnePlus.	5
As usual the mobile is awesome	5
Really enjoyed using this mobile	5
Love the phone, specially the feel of on screen fingerprint scanner, its quit slow in comparison to  the 6, but I like it. Battery life is improved a lot.	5
Awesome Phone loved it it's future proof I have bought the high end variant loved it has enough storage just take this phone true value for money	5
Bad camera quality	1
It is a nice phone under this price range.Camera and battery is superb, although I am missing 3.5 mm jack, but it comes with type c to 3.5 mm jack connector so no complains.Sound quality is good.	5
Amazing phone with amazing specs. Event i liked the in built fingerprint sensors, it works perfectly with no issues, and camera quality is amazing.	5
Battery is terribly bad.On round edges I lose the display as it cuts the actual view.Sometimes AutoRotate does not work. I have to restart the mobile.	1
U cannot xpect better from a phone than this.. a perfct combo of technology n beauty. Awsome performance!!!	5
After using 10 days, I am sharing my personal review on OnePlus 6T. It's the best phone with superb battery capacity. Pictures in low light are amazing. Speaker is very good & sound quality is also good. No unnecessary preloaded apps. Great performance indeed.	5
Makes apple cry	5
After alot of survey I finally landed for this one .It really does justify the tag of NEVER SETTLE the features and the feel this phone gives in the price range is actually unbeatable. Performance is so smooth that actually you can swipe between the apps just the pics in your gallery. Worth every penny if the amount.	5
Worst product i ordered on 1st november 2018 at 00.01 hours i got the product but only ised 1 day and now the phone is not charging and the phone is dead.Dint expect such a baaaaaaddd  product.I always used one plus but from now onwardd no one plus	1
AS EXPECTED.POWERFULL WEAPON	5
Beast has arrived.I'm pretty happy to move from IOS to this.Without any thought go for it and u wont regret for it.#Ididmymath	5
I loved the phone. The phone is very fast and clean. Good value for money	5
Only onething is not there... I.e. LED notifications... Except very good.	5
The dream phone for me best in every thing	5
All are good	5
Completely satisfied with the phone, already multiple reviews have been given on the phone so I would touch on my personal opinion alone. Amazon has to take care of the package delivery. The box was crushed almost on all sides. It's high time they focus on package quality. Zero star for this to Amazon, you're lucky if the phone comes in a single piece because the way the box looked I was really worried but luck was on my side. Thank God !!!*Pros*1. Premium feel2. Camera the best3. Speed, it is really fast enough4. User friendly OS and latest Android5. Battery and dash charging (15mins tips from 0 to 75% of battery)6. In display finger print is fast once you get used with right angle and spot. Trust me it is fast7. Annoying notification light is gone. As an alternative one tap on screen gives all notification*Cons*1. 3.5mm jack missing, may be we'll get used to it2. The dongle provided for 3.5mm jack is very thin, the wire is easily tend to break. Could have been thicker like the charger wire3. YouTube and play store often doesn't work with WiFi whereas via mobile data it works flawlessly. Hope an update will rectify this issue** Amazon put some quality time on package department**	5
Awesome phone great speed super camera....I love it	5
Awesome phone	5
What a phone man Life Life	5
Love it	5
Truly value for money. I have only one problem when i zoom in camera the picture totally blur is it normal or not otherwise it is good phone.	5
Wow,,away some product  but I can't receive headfone ,,,pls,solve my problemsThanks	5
The product is excellent. It is as per description. The packaging was nice and safe.	5
Excellent phone only reqmt is headphone is not provided by the company.	5
Best phone I have ever used	5
Second one plus in 4 years. Never settle indeed and I was never disappointed.	5
Best phone!!	5
I was initially hesitant to shift to Android after using iPhone for more than 4 years. But I went ahead with my gut and purchased this device on the very first day. The device came next day morning and trust me.. This device will amaze you.The device is very fast and battery is long lasting. In most cases, apps loaded faster than the latest XR (my friend and I were testing) and the OnePlus Camera is better than iPhone XR.The fingerprint unlock works as it should. It takes a little time longer than the screen unlock.Overall, this is the perfect device if you don't want to spend a fortune on the latest iPhone and want to give this a try.	5
Nice phone	5
Nice phone.bt parcel packing is not good	5
Love it.	5
pl do software update on receipt. we can feel a lot of change in phone performance by this	5
AI camera features could have been included	5

Awesome phone	5
Oneplus 6T is definitely a flagship killer.	5
One of the best phone with great performance... Worth buying it	5
Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money. Go for it!	4
Simply unique	5
I bought it for my friend and got 1k  amazon pay balance..!   	5
As Oneplus says "Never Settle", its true for the 1+ 6T as well. My first 1+ phone & the experience has been great till now. No lags, no slowdowns, no glitches, extremely snappy & powerful. I feel lucky using this phone. Its got the latest powerhouse sdm 845 inside with 8GB(my variant) ram which blazes through games & multitasking. The display is amazing & as its an Amoled screen, the colours are very punchy & saturated as well. Watching videos on my 6T is a true blessing. Everything seems so vivid & beautiful that i don't feel like watching movies on a television anymore. The screen is pretty big (6.41in) & the tear drop style notch makes it infact more immersive. The sound quality is very decent & the speaker is pretty loud despite being mono. The camera is amazing too which brings out decent looking pictures with fast focusing speed. Low light pictures are very decent as well & its not justified to expect anything more from a smartphone of this price tag. It very much lives up to the expectations. I would like to highlight one drawback though having Android 9(pie), some of the many apps & games on the play store doesn't seem to be well optimised for this new version of android & hence we might need to wait a few more weeks untill the developers of these apps optimise them better for the newer version of android which will then make the software experience even better. Overall its a great value & an extremely premium experience.	5
Phone is good in all aspects.	5
go for it, you are not gonna disappoint :)	5
Sound is good but not great .Battery life is very good .It is bit heavy but overall the best Android phone till date .	5
Love the display	5
mind-blowing purchase, one of the best seen or used so far at this price range.rocking in all aspects, no substitute for thisblindly go for this.	5
You just can't go wrong with this product	5

love this phone sound quality is so better.. and in display fingerprint scanner is so fast	5
first time purchased one plus phone & seriously it is awesome value for money product with this price range.Simple one liner review: go for it if you have this budget..	5
Excellent mobile worth your money	5
The phone loooks great sleek and shiny. Notch display adds more space to the phone.However lil disappointed with nightscape mode. Doesn't really captures good photos in dim light also slomo video quality is really poor.Rest all - Thumbs up	4
Everything about this phone is just awesome, superb battery, proper keyboard, sound is perfect, best camera ever, best thing about this phone is memory...really unlocking the speed... I am totally satisfied with this product.. Thanks OnePlus & also to Amazon..	5
1+ has proved it again. Have used Apple, Samsung and others..this is my first 1+ and I can say it's the best ever phone I have held in my hand till date. If you looking for a new phone..go ahead and buy it. Best part is this phone comes with a screen guard and back cover..so your phone will be safe right after unboxing and you do not need to Shell out extra from your pocket for these nitty gritty things.	5
Inside box no handset	5
Absolutely top notch phone!!! No need for big reviews with pros and cons. Just know that the pros are almost everything and cons are mostly limited to minor s/w bugs. This Onpelus keeps fixing very fast with OTA updates. Previously my only issue was that of Android OS updates as Oneplus was very slow or never pushed updates. This comes with the latest version of android and hoping for faster updates in the future.Battery life is legendary... Getting close to 6 hrs of SOT nd that's just phenomenal.Camera is great, may not compete with the pixel but who wants to anyway. At the price its just great.Lack of a headphone jack is a definite letdown but keep the in box dongle fixed to your existing earphones or upgrade to some good Bluetooth headsets during sale.Have not seen any major issues yet and performance is very smooth and super fast.The animations may feel a bit too buttery for some, in such cases go for changing animation scale in the developer options.Overall fantastic ... As subject says... Just buy this!!	5
Good phone	5
excellent product as expected.screen quality is suerb .overall i like this smartphone very much	5
Awesome phone in this price range , very fast , battery backup is superb and specially the internet speed is ia big plus point for the phone . Look wise it's ok but it's a beast .	5
I GOT A DEFECT PRODUCT WITH VERY LESS BATTERY LIFE FOR HALF DAY,TRIED TO CALL MANY TIMES AMAZON AND THEY HAVE DENIED TO REPLACE OR RETURN THE PRODUCT EVEN IT IS IN REPLACEMENT PERIOD. ONEPLUS COPIES EVERYTHING FROM VIVO V11 PHONE I THINK THEY SHOULD ALSO COPY BATTERY FROM MI AND ASUS.  WASTED 38000. IF U HAVE TO WASTE 38000 THEN GO FOR IT. IT NOT A FLAGSHIP KILLER ITS YOUR DREAMS KILLER PHONE. AND THEIR TAGE LINE IS  RIGHT THEY WILL NEVER LET U SETTLE. PLEASE DONT BUY ONEPLUS PHONE AND DONT BUY ANY PHONE FROM AMAZON	1
I got broken phone	1
Love it	5
Good	5
superb phone	5
Bad experience...mobile data not working despite tweaking the settings on both Jio and Vodafone sims. Not sure if I should wait for an update or return the phone in case there is something inherently wrong with the device.I used one plus one for 4 years. I was super happy with it. Recommended one plus to everyone. Got one plus devices for my family members too. I guess I was expecting a lot...6t is a let down for me	3
It is one of the best  phone I have come across. It is excellent in all parameters.	5
Amazing specs..flagship style at it's best. Takes a while to settle down with the absence of the audio jack and LED notifications, but that's One Plus for u #Never Settle	4
Everything is best.	5
Mobile was very very good daily keep 30 min charge valid for 24 hours with using 4g volte its coming	4
Loved it	5
Battery life and charging both are awesome...	5
Awesome phone by one plus value for money, best battery backup & smooth touch	5
Truly the best phone	5
Great picture quality even in low light. Impressive sound quality. Amazing battery life. On screen fingerprint scanner works fine and smooth with an impressive speed. Apps loads faster. Fast charger with 1-90 % in 20 minutes. Removal of 3.5 headphone jack is covered with an adapter. Slightly heavier if backcase is used. Overall worth the money.	5
Zoom could be better in camera	5
Very good battery life& picture quality	5
Finger print scanner makes little distrabence.Front camera is not good.	4
Awesome	5
Yarr kabhi bug he kabhi camera chipak jata he figrprint. Kam nhi karta or kabhi slow bhi ho jata he baki jabardast he	3
Everything is excellent	5
Better premium smart phone in Al concept	5
Awesome  Mobile phone. I sold out my iPhone and bought this phone and I love it #oneplus6T	5
As usual the mobile is awesome	5
Camera app ib pro mode is hanging, music app giving strange behaviour ( purchased one) FINGER PRINT SENCER NOT UP TO THE MARK Even after update install for bugfix.....not as expected	3
awesome phone with great specs at excellent price	5
Upgraded from 6 to 6tMy one line review - " I will pick 6 anytime over 6t"Some Important Points :On Screen fingerprint sensor is fast but of course not that past as physical fingerprint sensorCamera there is no change except the so called NIGHTSCAPE and if you are expecting it to be like one in pixel let me tell you that is a complete noAlgorithms of both the phones are different for low light photos and one used in one plus is bit shaggy .It basically illuminates the light sources present in the photo and spread it evenly over the entire clickScreen is good , notch is better than that old notchBattery is average , though they have increased the capacity but i dont see major differences in screen on time . Dash charge though is the best thing about one plusOverall Review : A power packed phone with good build and performance but now doesnt look like a flagship nor even a flagship killer	4
Super	5
This phone is really a flagship killer. It has all the things in the right quantity. Awesome camera, good picture quality, nice colors, fingerprint sensors works good. Processor is smooth as butter. A phone worth buying at 36k. If you are not using oneplus 6 then go for it. Oneplus 6 users can stay and wait for Oneplus 7	5
Just awesome	5
Built quality is very nice , premium feel , but little slippery with the mirror black back.. Always safe side to use with case.. The transparent case that one plus is providing in the box is good..Camera is really great. Both rear & front... Selfie potrait is really great...Device performance is something very unique in one plus 6t. I think this is the fastest one till now...Battery backup up is really good. It easily lasts for one & half day with moderate usage..Face unlock is simply too fast..Under display fingerprint is also very good.The tear drop notch really attractive..Overall it is the best budget smartphone to buy for 128gb..	5
Fastest Android phone	5
Fast as fast	5
Every thing is better in this phone.No comparison of this phone	5
I am very very satisfied with this product. Was a little skeptical of the performance but eventually my skepticism was put at peace. A 100% buy buy buy	5
I liked the product very much...it's awesome in the case of Sound and picture quality and Battery life also Great.	5
Battery super, back camera super, front cam average, fast charging aswm...	5
Amazing performance by 6T. The best smartphone in this price range.	5
Battery life is too good. The performance is very smooth and flawless although the VOLTE calling on the airtel network is not so responsive. Face unlock is quick and works in low lighting too without much lag. Recommend this phone.	5
The bottom front part could have so much more screen like the iPhone X , otherwise it`s a cool phone to have hands on.	5
What a mesmerizing smartphone!!	5
The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.Cons :Concern is the notification led light. we are not sure whether battery is 100% while charging. Single touch display to see notification is beautiful.One plus should have added the charge + 3.5 jack in type c converter. which would be added value for those who watch movie or listen song while charging.	5
Just one word for one plus 6t"Awesome"Go for it	5
Never bother about the on screen touch I'd. It has some problem but again you have face unlock. Performance, battery, screen quality are real premium.	5
Totally worth it !	5
I prebooked this phone from different id which I couldn't access again. Now my gift voucher is in my email and I couldn't use it during I bought this item. I need those earphones and I can share the Amazon gift code email screenshot. Please let me have those earphones. I bought this phone for pubg and pubg is impossible without earphones.	5
One speaker of the phone is not working what should I do.	3
Everything ok but battery life is not as expected.Earlier I was using Redmi Note 4 , compared to that phone it has 60% life only.I am not a heavy user just in sociel media usages it lasts 8-9 hrs only.	3
Like the sound quality	5
Fantastic product for that price. Headphone jack will be missed. Excellent water resistance and really premium finishing. The in-display finger print scanner is not that fast as the outside scanners. But it is not that big a headache.	5
Excellent phone	5
Crazy phone.....loved it	5
After a lot of samsung phones I have shifted in one plus through op3 and after 2 year and 6 month use there isn't a single issue I found in that phone. After a lot drop and marks on body the screen never cracked. Now I am using op6t since 4 days and fully satisfied with best picture quality, look and awesome performance. In one word a complete package and best value for money.	5
I had a awesome experience with this phone. A better battery life and had a awesome display. The AMOLED screen gives a better experience. And the main thing the camera.... It is mind blowing	5
Nice phone with this price	5
Indisplay Fingerprint Awesome..	5
Smartest, fastest, cleanest, lovable mobile. I have purchased midnight black colour. I strongly recommend to purchase.	5
The phone is really fast & the camera is great.	5
I have 8+128 gb varient oneplus 6t but Battery life is very poor its not working properly.	4
Camera is one of its best. No competition rather than Google Pixel Cams under this price range.Lightining processing with SD845:Awasome sound qulaity and battery life is not predictable at this stage, it will take another 1 month for the review100% guarantee that those who own this will have total mind statisfaction	5
Potrait view camera is average.  Picture quality is average. Sound quality is very good. Speed is good. Battery life is good. Should not have removed 3.5mm jack for ear phones. Price should have been 3k less.	3
Easily one of the most powerful smartphones in this price range. The 8GB variant is amazingly fast when it comes to applications or boot time. The picture quality has slightly improved from the One Plus 6 due to slight software tweaks. But the new slo-mo is insane. One of the best phones for video recording. Personally I love the teardrop notch but it does allow you to switch the notch look off which is among it's many customisable features. Oxygen OS is the best Android Based OS in the market right now according to me. Definitely buy this if you are looking for a mid range premium smartphone	5
Bought it for brother	5
Battery life is bad	3
Really great phone	5
No doubt the most awaited phone with all features.Pros:CameraBattery- Lasts easily for 28-30hrs with data ON all time.Display: No match , simply the best.Cons:-First day, I saw heating issue, but post the update a day later to the launch it seemed Normal.- BIGGEST DEMERIT: The OnePlus logo is not at all visible in Midnight Black version. Designers should have given a thought before bringing this color.	4
I m waiting for coupon code to purchase c earphone	5
As we all know, OnePlus had never disappointed it's customers. The only disappoint I had while buying this was, my OnePlus 6 was valued only for 9000. This shows how drastic the price of OnePlus can go down. Apart from this, the phone is completely similar to OnePlus 6 interns of build quality and performance. The due drop display has no special features. Just a apparel stuff. The fingerprint sensor in the front has both upside and downside. The upside is ease to use but the downside is, if your display breaks then you should be ready to pay a lot.	5
As compared to poco, it has a better screen, better software, a newer in display technology (which is not at all slow/ erroneous), a better camera etc.Not a big upgrade from one plus 6 tho :(	5
Superb ...	5
Good	5
Oneplus magic again Weldon one plus	5
Finally got delivery of my one plus 6t after owning one plus 1 for over 4 years. Loved it. Look and feel is ASOS one. Battery life is good . Havent been able to monitor the dash charge, but hoping that it meets expectation. Package comes with nice silicon case and phone is preinstalled with tempered glass, no need to buy another,	5
This is my second OP after OP5. Amazing phone. Here are some pros and cons-Pros-1) Water Drop Notch2) Screen Unlock3) Bigger Battery4) Amazing Camera on both sidesCons-1) If you wanna unlock your phone via either Screen Lock or Face Unlock, you have to make screen on,which is annoying sometimes. In this way I like my OP5 because there is FPS and I can unlock my phone just by pressing it. I am sure One Plus will look into this.2) Nightscape- Although I am very used to Oxygen OS but I cannot fully satisfied with Nightscape mode of camera. It always gives blurry pics but happy with overall performance.3) No LED Notification- Due to waterdrop notch they sacrifies Notification light, which is very disappointed from my perspective. well I think that if there is no hardware for LED notification then OP team should come with a software update by which a small pixel work just like a notification led.So here are some pros and cons. Considering these cons I still give 5/5. It's just amazing phone. And if you compere with any other smartphone for eg Pixel 3,then it is far way ahead of those.A must buy for premium phone lovers, I can bet you'll not get disappoint by this.	5
Overall at this price it's totally worth it .the thing no one will talk about  in reviews is the community which comes with the phone. Everyone is helpful and the company tries it's best to add features based on the suggestions of the community.	4
Its nice to hav oneplus mobile	5
Superb picture quality,high quality sound, long-standing battery..!	5
thanks to Amazon for same day delivery of deviceReally loving the in screen fingerprint unlocking system.. It's quite fast but not as fast as physical one like oneplus 6.Picture quality is great for both selfies and rear cam photos..Battery backup is good easily lasting for a day of normal use of social media's YouTube and little gaming..Performance is great.. Oxygen Os is very smooth to use and gesture control is really great to use.. 	5
It's a very nice phone in this range.35k in Amazon festival offer..I'm suggesting if you want to use long time phone plz go for this brand. it want slow, no battery issue..... It's my opinion	5
This is my 2nd phone of One Plus, previously used 5T. Honestly, I am very impressed with this phone as there is no problem in last 8 days.Everything is superb.	5
No words other than the word "AWESOME"	5
I use OnePlus 5...after that I fall in love with OnePlus...then upgrade to OnePlus 6t it was amazing...killer phone.	5
One plus 6t overall very good mobile, battery backup impressed	5
This is my first ever One Plus phone and I admit, with all all the hype there is about One plus, I strongly agree with them all. The OP6T has that premium feel when holding it and the build quality is just superb.The camera works magic and the night mode, well, just brilliant. Battery life is good enough for me as i am a heavy gamer and and uses the highest graphic properties available in the game which as we all know tends to consume a lot of battery but this varies from one user to another. Overall i give the OnePlus 6T a 9/10 rating and i certainly/ highly recommend this phone to people who wants to get a value for their money.	5
Value for money...	5
Very nice	5
Over priced smartphone	5
It's presently the best phone in the market.	5
Best phone I have ever used	5
all the function are very good	5
In love with the phone 	5
Super	5
I have recently bought OnePlus6T and have been using the phone from past few days. Here is my feedback on the phone:Pros:i. Android Pie is smooth in its functionality. The upgrades are definitely adding further improvement to the UI.ii. Camera is the best you can find in any phone. Low light photography is amazing. Front portrait pics are clean and decent. The quality of the photos are incredible and unbeatable with any other phone of the same price range.iii. Battery backup is unbelievable. One time full charge is approximately carrying for 9 hours which includes heavy gaming like PUBG.iv. Snapdragon processor is very fast. Under heavy graphics  HD mode, PUBG is smooth in its gameplay with hardly any lag.v. Dual sim VOLTE support is yet another added advantage with smart wifi switching option.vi. Sound is very high and crystal clear. The speaker is very powerful and mic is also very sensitive.Cons:i. The edges of the phone which are having place for menu, back button are little difficult to access with the case cover (Minimal problem but can be adjusted with)ii. Slight lag in the indisplay finger print sensor (taking little longer than expected) yet fast enough not to lag your work.iii. Ambient display brightness is sometimes unable to adjust in sunlight which may be stressful to the eyesOverall verdict is that the phone is a true definition for a flagship killer.NOTE: I was using Oneplus 3 earlier and my pros and cons are based on the comparision of my previous experiences	5
The best handest in 2018Guys really worth buying	5
Excellent brand & product.	5
So far so goodShared one pic(review) clicked by OnePlus 6TVery nice results. Using it.Waiting for the free bluetooth headphones from you(Amazon + OnePlus).Give me another chance to review it further.	4
Product is not upto the mark. Facing several issues within a week of the purchase itself.	2
I was earlier using the One Plus 3T. Upgraded and very happy with the purchase. Good display, great camera, fast performance with good battery life. Go for at least 8/128 GB model for long term use.	5
Very Satisfied	5
Awesome	5
Worth for money	5
After using it for a Week.Pros:1) Phone's battery life is great, lasts more than a day, using it across different Wi-Fi, Mobile networks, Calling, Surfing, Watching videos ... Still the battery holds good.2). Sound quality is good.3) Default back case that comes with box is good.4) Camera quality is good not that great!Cons:1) In-Display finger print scanner stops working randomly, I have to lock and unlock the phone again to make it works.2) The amount of time taken to unlock the phone via Fingerprint scanner lags sometimes but it works well most of the time.3) Night sight mode needs to be improved. The images taken with low lighting is not that great. Looks Ok Ok.	5
Done The'' Math '' ..came out winner..Good n recommendedNote having headfone jack not matters as wireless head fone abundant , free Type C bullets as launch offer and an adaptor for 3.5 mm jackGood sound ...sexy display n curves	5
Excellent	5
Amazing for the cost which they are selling	5

Camera pics and pixel quality low1+5t is far better option than thisFingerprint unlocks makes u wait and heating while getting my backup from cloud	2
Worth the wait with this amazing snapdragon845 beast with 6GB RAM.flagship killer for a reason Never Settle.	5
Excellent camera and display sound	4
Everything is good! Initially there was a delay while accessing in-display fingerprint. Post update that is also sorted. Cam is super clear!With 100% usage the backup is up-to 16-18 hours. Oneplus 6 users may not love it as there is no much difference comparatively!Pre-booking offer should have been wireless rather than a wired headset.	5
Average camera quality and battery life, sound quality good, face unlock good, while capture photos in room light not real colour comes into photos	4
From the moment I switched on the device I am awestruck by the ease of use and the functionality underneath. By far this has been the best smartphone experience for me and would definitely give a big thumbs up to the OnePlus team for developing such a beautiful piece of work.	5
The picture quality is awesome, sound quality of media and calls is great and getting battery life of over 1.5 days. Display is amazing. FOD is flawless. Just loving the phone. Worth every penny	5
Ssssssssssuper !!!!!	5
Well, as they claim, it is a flagship killer.Superfast charging, barely takes and hour to charge almost full. Speaker is loud enough.Worth the money. OnePlus also proved their worth over the years by providing timely android updates for a long time. So this phone can be used for atleast 5 years without any worries.Totally loved it.Got it delivered in less than 12 hours, all credit goes to Amazon.in for that.	5
Just an amazing experience with one plus... Best phone till date...	5
Excellent phone ....	5
Just go for it.... It's worth every penny invested to it.. and if you are having a OnePlus 6 then don't upgrade it.	5
Though the battery is 3700 mah .it is not giving that much of back up as i expected.	5
Best phone ever ....worth to buy this 6t picture sound battery awesome	5
Very fast delivery with amazon in just 12hrs,  A very good product of one plus,  Face lock on time. Camera is outstanding , Fantastic phone,  Worthy for 42k.  Battery life is good.	5
Wonderful Product and Recommending to use the same	5
Product, service every thing good but back cover quality very poor.	5
Delivery: Fast than expectedPackaging : GoodPhone: really awesome, faster startup time, smooth gesture, dual 4G with quick data switch shortcut.Add on : USB type c to 3.5 jack converter(For me, I have wireless earphone) , back cover.Good to have or required : If you have wireless earphone which has micro USB for charging, then need convertor to avoid another charger if u r travelling.	4
Sound quality is best	4
The main thing I like about this device is it's AMOLED display. It's really cool! And the Oxygen OS! There are no words to describe it's butter smooth UI! It's really awesome. Battery life is good.Obviously we cannot expect a 2-3 days of battery backup in phones with flagship features. But one full charge is enough and more for day to day use.Supports dual 4g.In display finger print scanner is a magic! Yes I know that it is slow when compared to physical fp scanners(difference in milliseconds), but I personally believe that there is nothing to do in phone after unlocking it in this 'milliseconds' time. No one will feel that it is slow.One plus guarantees regular software updates. I was surprised to see an update for improvised gestures and finger print unlock after setting up the phone for first use!  It is worth for its price. On top of that one plus support team is always there for hearing your issues and solving them.	5
how to redeem my bullet earphones I didn't receive any code sms of the earephonnes	5
The oneplus 6t is very good but the unboxing for the late bookers a 3 translucent coloured case should have been provide , howere the head phones are not available but atleast 3 cases should have been provide very disappointed one plus for thisThe phone is very fast an it's amazing	4
picture quality really superb battery life sound quality and perfomance too good	5
Amazing phone, highly recommended A++++++	5
Yet to find out. Too early to comment	5
Very good picture quality, sound	5
Feels premium.... Super performance	5
All the features of the phone are superb.... A perfect beast for rough use.	5
Provide head set and gorilla glass with the hand set.	5
I expected more, overall it's a good phone	4
Whoever is doing the math (if you know what I mean), stop right there, this phone is absolutely a fantastic device, really amazed with its battery, I am a heavy user, so it lasts 1/1.5 day without any hicup, so if you are thinking of owning a flagship, this is for you, for camera I would rate 4.5/5, for performance absolute 5/5, so why are you still thinking, grab it now.	5
One plus 6t ohhhh my...it rocks...	5
Good phone	5
As always oneplus 6t is an awesome device to have.The on screen finger print is responsive and looks stylish.The delivery was quick for my pincode.	5
No words!!!! Awesome product from one plus team.. kudos	5
It's a kick ass phone as of now the best smart phone with real good battery life , i have played games , saw movie heard songs on it the battery was at 99% post 1 - 1.5 hours it only took 12 -13%. It gets charged super quick . Display & sound are out of the league .I would definitely recommend this phone	5
Nice mobile	4
Good	4
Phone is vary fast, camara is awesome and battery last about 1.5 day.	5
Well one plus 6T is awesome. It's truly a flagship killer. Camera cud have been a bit better but hey it's ok nothing can be too perfect right	5
Good product	4
I think this phone is overrated. Quality wise it is good, but photos has very low pixel quality. Finger print scanner is also not working fast.Gaming and processing speed is awesome. Never gets hang.	3
battery is draining like anything.	2
Hi,I am a new user of High-end flagship. I am really proud of my mobile because it has a Good camera+battery life..... If you have interested to buy one plus 6t then go for it.	5
Phone is simply superb in all aspects...	5
Good	4
6T looks awesome. It's fast. I think it's worth the price.	5
Best Android phone till date. I have been using it for 3 days now and OnePlus didn't let me down.* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.This is the best phone you can buy in 2018 and early 2019 at around 35-40k. So go ahead and buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it!	5
Works smoothSwitched from iOS let's see how it goes	4
Good	5
Oneplus is always great and they havent let me down in this on either. A great device, though i wanted a bit more updated version of the OP 6 in respect of its camera hardware but hmm yeah i am not sorry for buying this device rather I am enjoying it.	5
if someone ask me which phone should I buy ill 101% recommend for one plus 6T	5
Great phone in terms of performance, speed and looks. I'm using my Bluetooth head phone and it's working great no need of headphone jack. Go for it without any doubt. Using phone from last 4 days. Even fast charger is mind blowing.	5
My first one plus phone and I have opted for the ryt one great camera with perfect dash charger ... A complete phone ... Keep up the good work OnePlus	5
Pros:Really high speed mobileGood memory space upto 120Gb,On screen fingerprintDisplay is impressiveCamera quality is good in days and night but not alwaysFast chargingiPhone competetiveCons:Price is high(mine is pre-booked, better than now)Battery could be of higher capacityFingerPrint not so fast but seems faster than other device on screen finger print readerNo FM RadioSometime night mode camera is not working as expected	4
Flagship killer indeed!!	5
Only one of the speakers is working. Is that a software tweak?	4
Its all about speed, apps launch pretty fast and multi tasking also smooth.Earlier I was using s6edge so following comparison is with respect to it,Camera - default pic quality more or less same, but with pixel 3 camera apk the true capability of cam comes outBattery - far better, Samsung is drain houseBuild quality - at par	4
I was note 8 user,i sold my note and got one plus 6t ,best killer phone 2018,camera and screen and battery is awesome	5
I just have just 2 things to point out this phone except that this is fabulous I am currently njyng the phone.1.Finger print scanner is not that quick.2.When it's scanning (fingerprint) brightness will be increased Wich will be a bit unknowing at nights.	4
All rounder	5
One of the best Android phone I have ever used.. sound quality and picture quality is awesome.Missing Earphone Jack is not a problem as Bluetooth do the needful. Many people made a hype of it but truly it doesn't matter, if you are updated with technology.Phone looks classy and elegant too..	5
This is my 1st oneplus device. Phone is killer.No cons except Fingerprint sensor accuracy and speed. Sometimes I got the same error as 'not recognized'.Otherwise device is a beast.Camera is awesome but need some works on optimization.Smooth processing and touch feel also very impressive.	4
Great phone!Speakers could be stereo though.	5
One word.. BEAST	5
Damn crazy phone! Sad for not given a 3.5 jack, carrying that conncetor is a pain	5
Hanging problem selfi camera not good	1
I was little worried about my moving from samsung to oneplus but when i got device - Its really Amazing. Display qwality is Excellent . I dont need sount so i didnt spend any time to its external sound qwality but when i listen earphone qwality its was too superb in my basic earphone means phone sounds is also good. Camera Performances is mindblowing when you turn on selfie camera in full mode then you ll see - it ll show you actual color contrast instead of fake beauty color like oppo /vivo/ now samsung also. True color comes with minor effects. Rear camera superb in Daylight . I think more time needed to understand full camera mode skills to take better pics. I installed pixel 3 camera port apk in my 6T - guys youll be amaze to see its effect .truely outstanding. I share this pic which i took in late light almost 01.00 AM in very low light . Here i wanna ask the oneplus developers that when this camera app works too better in 6T camera hardwrae then i think it this algorithym should be take in 6T stock camera night scape mode bcz 6T camera capable to take this brighter shots by this app then whynt from stock app ?Overall experience is in one word :-Right decison for change the Taste	5
Awesome phone	5
Nice product but we are expecting tampered glass along with this product but you are not giving it along with the product. Finally one plus 3t a flagship killer reasonable price.	5
Dash charging is just awesome.C type to 3.5mm Adapter provided in the box for earphones.Easy gesture settings and user friendly shortcuts and features.Fabulous picture quality.Awesome video experience with enlarged screen.All in all 6T is class.. My bad that i dropped my phone twice since the day i bought it, but thanks to gorilla glass and cover (in the box) from OnePlus, there had been zero damage and no scratch at all	5
NICE PRODUCT WITH GOOD QUALITY	5
At last one plus 6T of s in my hands.... I don't need anything for now.. Thanks god.. :D	5
There are two speaker but one is not working please help	5
Best mobileGood quality OnePlus is best	5
	5
This is a perfect phone i ever used	5
Best product but original bill was missing	5
Picture quality is not up to the mark (7/10)But one of the best quality mobile is it's performance.Finger print sensor need some more updates.I just seen few of the reviews below that ppl are complaining about the display, but I totally disagree with those folks. I'm very much attracted for one plus 6t bcoz of it's AMOLED display more than the onscreen  fingerprint. Trust me display quality is flawless.Overall, worth buying it.	5
I am completely happy with the device.1.Good camera2.6hr30min sot3.Good display.4.in display finger working fine.Overall excellent device.	5
Firstly i would like to thank oneplus for making a device like that. The best part of the phone is the performance which you expect from a snapdragon 845 chip  ..  obviously you are paying for that.(Or han" don't do the math" i have poco f1 too,, 6t is better in everything. worth paying more.. )*Now the Issues are..1.  Lack of 3.5mm jack  which can be a deal breaker for many people.  But honestly not for me.  Because i don't have a wired earphone or headphone. It's 2k18 even my car doesn't have an aux port.  (Android auto).  If still u want to use then there is a connector comes with the box.2 .  Notification led.If they provided a led on the top of display then you have to compromise with that beautiful notch.  Again not a deal breaker.*Important*I have seen many people are saying in reviews. That they have not received cash back  or type c bullet earphones with box.  Not sure about. The cash back. But. If you pre book this device. It is mentioned that u will receive a code to purchase those earphones by 15 nov.  U will not get those with the box..And about the cash back i had purchased it at rs 46k(8ram 256rom) nd  i received that 1000 instantly nd 500 on 5th  nov.Chaliye ab kuch buraiya bhi karde*Sound quality can be better..*Not ip certified. It is just splash proof (but i don't know how to swim so I'm not taking my phone in pool... again not a deal breaker)Buss ab kharid lia or burai nhi hoti.	5
~Performance is very good.....~Killer phone...~Camera quality is very very nice....~nigh mode is very good...~battery back up is also good...~face unlock is very fast...Quick response~Almost very good...~price is very high....but quality is very good...	5
Purchased the Midnight Black with 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage. A premium smart phone which is sleek, fast and good looking. Have been using the system for nearly a week and am very impressed with the performance of the phone. Battery charge is holding for a good 2 days and thanks to super fast charging, it gets charged soon. Have been watching videos and playing games like Asphalt 9, Need for speed, Fifa. The Graphics and performance is very good. Sound quality is good. Haven't noticed any heating issues so far.Impressed by the on screen fingerprint scanner. Face detection is also awesome. Haven't noticed any lag.Call quality is very good.Overall a very good, solid built phone	5
Loved it	5
It's just Awesome.. Funtastic Speed.. Nice Display and Battery..Removal of 3.5mm audio jack and No Wireless Charging are giving some dislikes..	5
Sound quality is awesome. Charges rapidly.	5
Ok	2
REVIEW after using 7 days.I bought Midnight Black with 8GB RAM + 256GB Storage.1. It's a truly Premium smartphone2. OnePlus has excellent service n support3. No heating4. Excellent camera quality.5. Battery Backup is excellent. On screen display is almost 7 hours in my case.6. Luv the Amoled display7. Superfast Dash Charger8. Sound is also loudOverall I will rate it 5 out of 5.Thanks Guys... :)	5
Till now nothing to dislike but wireless charging would be an added advantage	5
My first premium phone and the best in this price range with very good battery life.	5
Beast of all	5
A beast at it's best and price is so we'll managed when compared to other brands with same specifications. There are alot of options for customization and you love it . Android used at it best over customization.	5
Overall best phone in the market	5
Realy looks good and worth to buy... Compare between 6 and 6T price cost is very high.. Changing slight changes added 10k extra.. Its too much....	5
I am a OnePlus user since OnePlus2Very stubborn to buy OnePlus all the time and always it meets the expectationPros:1. Excellent Camera Quality2. InDisplay Finger Print3. Night Scape Mode4. Safety Earphone Jack5. Battery Backup6. Amazing performance7. Premium design8. Excellent rear and front cameraCons:1. No option to control ring volume by pressing volume buttons2. Missing 3.5mm earphone Jack (Can Manage with converter provided)3. Need to improve finger print sensor accuracy and can reduce the brightness of icon4. No notification LEDOverall phone is excellent, definitely you will love it... :)	5
Sound quality	5
Bestest Phone ever I have purchased in my life...Camara is ultimate, I Phone is nothing front of Oneplus6T.	5
Worth of money	5
Fantastic mobile fabulousJust go for it	5
Wow  superb camera quality, ultimate built quality and performance..	5
Just bought OP6T on Nov 1st. So far great experience. Just one word AMAZING...The finger print scanner looks great and I kind of like the fancy feel that it provides. The phone operates smooth and the battery back up is bang on!!! With high end usage it lasted 1-1.5 day approx. With minimal usage I could get 2 days out of it. I love the reading mode (kindle app), however not like kindle though..;-).Cons: 3.5 mm audio jack absence is something that you might feel for a while.On the flip side, this trend of removing audio jack is quite catching up if you see in all the recent launches. So, probably this is something futuristic. Overall, great features. Being my first experience with one plus, I must say I loved the experience so far. Will be back with detailed review in the near future...	5
Awesome phone with best picture quality and with best battery backup.	5
Super	5
Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money. Go for it!	4
Somehow not as defined as I expected this phone to be. The SW is patchy and some apps are not integrated well enough like true caller. The camera is a big setback for me and I don't see the same quality as one plus 5. Night pics are a disaster. Maybe the next set of updates might improve the experience. Overall an average product. Expected much better.	3
In simple words, FAST!In complex words, REALLY FAST!Unlocks like a dream, performs like theres no tomorrow.The in-display finger-print scanner is very quick, but isnt a match to One Plus 6s physical scanner. Nonetheless, this is a technology which had to be explored.If you own a One Plus 6 already, then you shouldnt worry. For others, you got to check this out, because this is value for money and delivers the speed that you DESERVE!	5
Amazing Phone	5
I got the best Phone..The real flagship killer. Thank you Oneplus for this Phone. Amazing Camera, Speaker, Buil Quality...	5
smooth and fast	5
Best	5
Truly value for money. I have only one problem when i zoom in camera the picture totally blur is it normal or not otherwise it is good phone.	5
Excellent phone	5
Great phone. A must buy. Just one issue till now, audio equalizer doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones.	5
I have used iphones and latest was pixel 2XL. Was very sceptical about buying this one plus 6t thinking it might be just a Chinese phone.But to my surprise I was wondering how actually we are being cheated by Google and Apple for such high pricing for their flagships.This phone is just having all the right things at such a affordable price.Pros:Dual simVolte and good WiFi and network receptionBattery lasts for one and half days - goodDisplay is having good screen to body ratioCamera is better and not awesome when compared to google PixelNo heating up or hanging issuesSlim and handyCons:Display is not having that much clarity when compared to Samsung or other flagshipsConclusion:Yup. This is a phone made with so much sense and thinking. Don't waste money in spending for brands. Go for this phone. It is a package with all features with good pricing and will never disappoint you. Thanks for reading.	5
Recommended phone... Having a premium feel. Processor speed is awesome. Regarding battery - showing some speedy drain in the beginning until 70-80%, after that it comes in stables condition, and lasts longer. So far good performance.	5
Fabulous product I love it	5
One Plus 6T is the best phones from one plus. Some of the pros and cons of the phone isProsNew fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edgeUp-to-date, versatile OSFast Charge is still greatSleek, premium designGreat performanceGreat battery lifeConsCamera's Nightscape mode needs workFingerprint sensor needs refinementOne plus 6t has one of the best display in the phone in its range and even gives tough competition to some other high end phones. Camera is one of the best highlight of this phone adding Night scape mode gave its camera edge over other phones. But taking photos on Night scape mode is too slow one plus has to work on it.In display finger print sensor it is one of the highlight of this phone but one plus has to work on it refinement. Recently one plus has one given one upgrade to fix slowness problem in Indisplay finger sensor. Now it fast but still need improvement. Phone is super smooth no lags nothing even playing high end games. Dash charing is super quick 35 - 45 minutes is enough for full charging.	5
I love it	5
After the update I have some problem download issues	4
Picture quality was fantastic and sound clarity also very nice . Totally product is very good loved it	5
The phone is really awesome.. i droped this phone from 7feet while opening the box.. i thought phone display is gone.. but.. nothing happened... I love this phone..	5
Great phone must buy  great price and great specs if u have budget for 40k go for it	5
Can be better	4
Good Features ...	5
Such an amazing phone! Never Settle with any other mobile device!	5
Just one word for this beast `Awesome`	5
It is one of the astonishing things that I ordered. The phone is just amazing and flawless and the camera steals the show.I really like on screen finger print scanner and it works perfectly fine if you do it properly. Yes, it will takes time to settle but then It is One plus 6t.The packing was good but there were no air bags to stop the box from moving inside a larger box. Other than that everything is just amazing.	5
Picture quality: superbSound quality: superbBattery life: easily getting 2 days life without charging again.Fast charging in 45 minutes full charge	5
Hello Guys, its been 1 week since I got (8GB/256GB) one of the best phone in market. As expected OnePlus deliver customs expectations.Regarding phone its of course best in the market, battery charging takes around 75 minutes from 5% to 100%. Discharging is pretty normal compared to its competitors. Photo clarity is good enough in normal/ portrait mode but night mode I dont feel good enough, it takes longer time to stabilise and we need to hold and wait. Video and photo clarity is good but not the best in market or less comparatively than my Lumia 950XL. Fingerprint sensor is not much sensitive and takes .5 to 1 sec to open, had a angle problem which resolved in recent update but still lag remains same. Face recognition is perfect. I feel phone is in top 5 for gaming with separate gaming mode, dont see any lag in WCC 2/ Asphalt/ PUBG. Screen size, display is pretty good and as expected. Sound quality is same as its lower end models no much difference. Overall I am happy with other specifics except night mode, fingerprint sensor.	5
As usual oneplus delivered a good smart phone	5
Just one word AWESOME,total value for money, the bestest camera i have ever used, go for it.#the_best	5
OP6T Nailed it	5
Simply the best...Use below codes to buy one plus 6T for future offers...57MM-QYXC7Z-X9HMFBD72V-UUMHDX-YWAA5XKV5W-JYDDK6-ZYKV7VFRN3-TLLJ2W-2A4QH9K2Z4-8ANYMD-XW568E	5
I played pubg with low graphic for almost 4hrs. Here is the screenshot for that.Loved the nightscape,sound is bit loud , it is fast and smooth, good battery life,selfie camera is not that good,charging is fast. Loved the fingerprint sensor not that fast but will open in quick time. Faceunlock is realy fast. Pubg runs very smooth at high setting	5
Pros:1. Great camera2. Battery life is just woww3. Looks & big screen4. Not too heavy5. Doesn't get heated even while playing games like PUBG6. Amazing unlocking on display7. Speaker quality is good and very loud8. Separate button for General mode, vibrate mode and silent mode9. Worth the priceCons:1. Earphone slot should have been given, you have to carry that connector always2. What else?! "Never Settle"	5
Not good for pubg mobile . Heating issues	2
Superb phone	5
i want to mention that right side speaker is just for aesthetic purpose not a real speaker	5
Everything about this phone is just awesome, superb battery, proper keyboard, sound is perfect, best camera ever, best thing about this phone is memory...really unlocking the speed... I am totally satisfied with this product.. Thanks OnePlus & also to Amazon..	5
phone is working very good.display,battery life,sound everything is ok.	5
Being an Iphone user i can say Iphone's camera is much better than OnePlus's camera. Very good battery backup. Faced few glitches like double tap wake up sometimes doesn't reponds. In-Display finger print scanner takes ages to unlock sometimes.	4
It's amazing amazon performed mobile everything in this mobile . Never settle it's wrong I am settled.nice thing no extra	5
OK ok	4
Excellent mobile......	5
display notch is very good, large  bettry, in display fingerprint works faster after update, camera quality is best , night mode is also good..overall super fast performance..	5
Everything is fine	4
It's great	5
The phone performanc, picture quality and battery life is too good. Like this android after switching from iOS	5
Good phone but looking at hype and time taken to release I had expected much more. Nothing new in phone	3
Best in quality for sound, battery life and picture.Value for money	5
A perfect successor for OnePlus 6	5
Superb product... Worth buying it	5
charging efficiency of the mobile is phenomenal. Os experience is super smooth.only draw back is potrait mode in camera is not upto my expectations. According to me nothing can beat apple in terms of camera department. I dont like google pixel phones so i dont account them into my calculations.for reference i upgraded from iphone 7 plus to oneplus 6t	5
Good phone, but no wireless charging	2
I love OnePlus	5
I have been using this device for over a week now and so far it has turned out to be a beast of a device. Here are my observations:1. The in-display screen unlocker: It is flawed. Takes a bit of a time to unlock and you have to place the finger properly. But this was not that big of a deal, since the face unlocking is supremely fast. Its a novelty kind of thing. looks nice when it works. 4/5 for this2. Camera: my previous device was OP 5t. The picture quality has increased manifold. Nightscape, studio lighting and ultra slo-mo video works like a charm. 5/5 for this3. Battery life: the first day, the device got slightly heated when i used oneplus switch so the battery drained quickly. But over the week, it has given me wonderful battery backup. No heating issue. With average to heavier usage, it still gave me 1.5 days backup. The charging is very fast. 40 minutes to charge from 10 to 95%. More than sufficient. 4.75/5 for this4. Speaker: Only one speaker is present, but it gives out very loud output. Gives very good clarity and loud ringing. No complaints or issues regarding this. 5/55. OS: It is the cleanest and simplest OS yet. Lots and lots of customization, minimum bloatware. clean interface. in OP5T, the messaging app did not differentiate between marketing related messages and actual messages. fortunately, this phone has that capability. Loved the gestures as well. Optimizations are also great new feature. 5/56. Build: All one plus devices are wonderfully built and 6T is no exception. Even though the glass back is there, I didnt find any slippage. Of course I am using the back cover which is already provided with the phone now. But I think it has much better grip than the other phones. 5/5Bottom line is that this is a device which you would want to own for a long time. Most of the budget phones start developing problems within 1 year of manufacturing, but that has not been my experience with One plus devices.  Even after more than 1 year of using OP 5T, I still got the same performance I was getting during my first month with it. 6T is slightly costly but completely worth it in my opinion.	5
The best company and the best phone .. in all sense	5
The Speed You Need its right caption for this phone compared 6t with iphone XS, the peak performance and battery backup and multitasking with heavy apps One Plus 6t made its mark on iphone Xs, great phone to buy worth of each penny.	5
This is my first one plus device and after using it for a week i would tell u this is a monster device battery is awesome back cameras is fine need a bit improvement in the front camera awesome for gaming .premium look in the hands while using .unbeliveable fast charging quick unlocking with face in low light  and plz dont compare it with vivo and mi brands .this is far too ahead of them	5
Amazing product	5
Nice display. Really very much fast. Decent camera and battery life	5
i already had a OP5. It wasthe brst phone n wlnow i updated the phone it's a beast ...vi like the phone.	4
Best value smartphone for the time being!!! Superb battery, Camera, Features. Couldn't ask more	5
Great product	5
There is nothing to complain about the phone. Love the waterdrop notch.	5
Picture is good , speaker is not as much louder as my Moto X style but it's ok. And battery life is good almost one day life with normal uses.	5
Excellent product. Simply s3xy mobile. Go for it	5
The One Plus 6T is amazing . Everything is just amazing than iPhone . Speed is great .But the people having one plus 6 there is no need to upgrade now .	5
It's wonderful phone..	5
Camera quality is not up to the mark, fingerprint on screen is slow and not at all convenient.Price is also too much high. Not at all value for money.	2
The phone loooks great sleek and shiny. Notch display adds more space to the phone.However lil disappointed with nightscape mode. Doesn't really captures good photos in dim light also slomo video quality is really poor.Rest all - Thumbs up	4
Amazing battery life and a great experience to use it. I would say this phone is one of the best phone in  industry till date at this price range.(6+128).	5
A very good phone with a budget price	5
Good phone to have.	5
Picture quality worst	1
Nice Product but bit heavy...Need to get IP68 rating and make it dust proof and water proof...	3

THANKS FOR GIVING THIS AWESOME MOBILE EXPERIENCE TO ME,	5
I'm a fan of Oneplus. OP 6T is really great in build quality, slightly thicker than oneplus 3 but that feels good in hands. On comparing photos with my OP 3 then OP 6T is a mood off. Also, the finger print scanner animation is very slow. It doesn't give you idea of the instant the phone will get unlocked, eventually making you keep finger for more time. And this happens every time. I still prefer my OP 3 over my dad's OP 6T in terms of low-light photograph and fingerprint. Also, fingerprint animation is poor in UI. Display of phone is nice though.	3
Great	5
Its amazing product guyss...its truly flagship killer phone in terms of uses premium build quality....in display fingerprint camera night scape mode with latest andriod pie	5
Powerpack phone....Go for it without any doubt....	5
Not received promised ear phone and other items as pre delivery was done on first announced date	2
It's a wow phone.What an imagination!	5
Best phone ever used in all manner.only the price should be within 30-34 k.Camera is very nice.I love the oxygen is and it's features ,It is near stock Android.Thanks Android update pie..I think it is the first phone non Google which has Android pie out of box.Lastly best flagship phone in all respect and in all departments.	5
The phone is a power pack in all terms and aspects. Images on daylight are amazing with lots if details. Battery life is good and in daily use one can get a whole day backup with an amazing fast charging which is available with the dash charger. Performance is tremendously awesome. Nothing can be more smoother in this price segment. And it comes with android 9.0 within the box. And within 4 days I have got 2 new ota updates and now it is running android 9.0.5. which comes with even more fast in display finger print unlock.	5
Really enjoyed using this mobile	5
Everything working fine	5
Good	5
Wow it's too good superb...Awesome mobile.	5
Phone with all richness	5
Before getting the phone replaced, I had given a terrible review about one plus 6t. The first phone I received had camera and heating issues. The flash stayed awake for upto 4-5 seconds every time I clicked photo and would heat up like a skillet. Had to factory reset the phone twice, but the heating issue persisted.Now that I have received a replacement...loving the phone. It's butter smooth performance and excellent camera have destroyed all my negative opinion...	5
First of all thanks to Amazon for getting this product delivered within 24 hours time. It was an amazing experience starting from opening the kit and experiencing the same.Fantastic display & build quality. Terrific camera with good support of nightscape function. Big battery lasting for the day and on. Operation moves like " makkhan " without glitch. Special mention of one plus switch software for transfer of date from my earlier phone to new one. Lastly awesome sound in the headset though speaker sounds little louder.Never mind it doesn't have round Jack for headset and also absent of LED notification.I can definitely forget the above two against those beautiful features the One plus 6T offers.Great kudos to one plus team!!	5
Wow amazing phone I have ever used. Battery life is really awesome. picture quality is damn good. I got this phone on offer on 1st November which was a very good deal.	5
Excellent phone in the market	5
Sorry one plus, camera is worst pls don't by this only in the name of one plus and call conferencing is a big issue in this device.....V11 pro is far better then this over price device.	3
The overall phone performance is good. Picture Quality is also awesome. Sound is also upto the mark. overall best phone to have. Night mode works excellent.. Portrait option with front and rear. Battery back up is also good not excellent.Phone speed is also best.. The phone looks classy.. not bigger or smaller in size..Thanks Amazon.. i received this product on Diwali.. So it's best Diwali gift for me..	5
Great Phone !	5
Excellent..	5
Everything is good about the phone but the in-display fingerprint sensor is substantially not accurate and consistent. OnePlus should have gone with the physical fingerprint reader and should have waited for the new Qualcomm 3rd gen in-display fingerprint sensor.OnePlus actually made its phone slower with this in-display technology by implementing it too soon.Camera is great as it is always been but the night mode shots are with the night mode is not good at all and infact the normal camera mode in the night will give you better shots as compared to the night mode.	4
The OnePlus 6T could be a really nice phone notwithstanding what the value, however at half the price of AN iPhone XS with a newest in show fingerprint sensing element this can be the cut-price get of the year. everyone is complaining regarding in-display fingerprint scanner is slow however trust American state its terribly in no time, the phone gets unbolted as shortly as your finger touches the screen and a lot of correct than alternative phones, this can be the smartphone that brings all-screen style up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that the newest technology doesnt need to value the world, delivery AN in-display fingerprint scanner and a small notch for simply 37K. The attractive, crisp and vibrant OLED show could be a whit larger at half dozen.41in, with a smaller chin at very cheap is just wonderful, coming back to the camera the new nightscape low lightweight mode will an honest job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is additionally pretty sensible Portrait mode works as publicized, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is nice and once you use the fingerprint sensing element the night mode for the show is disabled quickly and so fades back in once youve unbolted the phone. The phone comes with a screen guardian already thereon. the one bottom-firing speaker is loud and includes a comparatively great amount of bass for the phone, however, is definitely blocked whereas enjoying a game. OnePluss alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and continues to be good. OnePlus phones have continually been sensible for the money, providing prime specifications in well-built devices, however not pushing the boundaries of whats doable. Thats modified for the OnePlus 6T. it's pushing whats doable with the favored all-screen style employing a small, enticing teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and its a more robust phone for it. however it's the introduction of a newest in-display fingerprint scanner, ANd creating it works rather well for as very little as [*fr1] the value of an iPhone XS, that's most spectacular. theres no wireless charging, it doesnt have any of the flowery 3D face systems of some and it's a bit plain, however, everything else is a prime notch. Even the software package expertise is superb.Pros:- sensible battery life, nice screen, wonderful performance, dual-sim, sensible camera, Bluetooth five, nice software package, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensing element, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, cheap worth relative to premium phones, last however not least Blazing quick software packageCons:- No notification lightweight, glass back, however, no wireless charging, no expandable storage.Overall the phone is superb and it very delivers it's tagline ne'er Settle.Being an Amazon pre-BookingStill Delivery Was postponed by a day And Packing is extremely Poor.....	4
What a phone man Life Life	5
Awesome	5
u get everything in this phone within your budget with superb quality....go for it guys...worth the money....no problems are there till now with 8 days of uses...fast and secure delivery  of amazon :)	5
I LOVE ONEPLUS PHONES BUT I HAD RECEIVED A OENPLUS 6T DEVICE WITH A SCRATCH ON THE SCREEN PROTECTOR WHERE THE FINGER PRINT SCANER IS PLACED.. ITS NOT GOOD ONEPLUS ...TOTAL DISPOINTMENT..DONT KNW IF THEY REPACK THE PHONE ....PLEASE NOTE THAT AMEZON AND ONE PLUS	4
Over all mobile is amazing...	4
Go for it!	5
This phone is a beast to say the least. SD 845 processor can handle anything and everything thrown at it. It's butter smooth and looks very classy. All glass body looks very premium in nature. Battery has not been that good since I have been using it. Maybe it is due to some rogue app draining it faster. Nevertheless it's a complete package from OnePlus. I've been a loyal OnePlus user since the day they launched in India. They never disappoint their customers to say the least. This latest offering from OnePlus is surely the best they have had till date.	5
This is the best phone I have purchased so far. I ONLY use iPhone's but this is beyond all the brands, best features, camera, price, look, speed...... Just go for it...!!!!	5
Features and design is great. Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sometimes not recognizing.	4
I am first time user for OnePlus mobile it's really awesome what a speed mobile and quality super mobile	5
Excellent product.	4
Flagship killer. Best phone for me. So smooth. Awesome camera. Smart RAM optimization. It's a piece of cake for this phone to run graphic intensive games. Battery life is just awesome.	5
The best one	5
One word. awesome phone.. Go for it.. Loved it..	5
I am using this phone for a week. here are my views on this phone.screen - AMOLED screen, colors are vivid and pics look beautiful in this screen. brightness can be adjusted from very dark and very bright which makes it easy to use in night and in sunlight.battery- 3700mah -  last more than a day. using dash charging is awesome. it charges so quickly.software - fast and fluid. close to native android and bug free. Already got 2 updates and gestures support.finger print scanner -  bit slow than traditional one but it is perfectly usable in day to day life. works perfect everytime.camera -  nightscape feature is useful to take pics in very dark situation. i installed google camera and used night sight feature. night sight feature is much advanced and takes more bright pics than nightscape mode. but am happy that one plus may improve this feature in next software update. pics taken in daylight is awesome and portrait mode is also very nice.headphone jack -  3.5mm jack is missing but adapter is given in box. Audio quality is very good for average user and speaker loudness is appreciable enough to fill a room.Overall you can never get disappointed with this phone. it delivers in all spheres and easily one of the best phone among flagships and available at affordable price tag.Big thumbs up.....	5
Best phone ever	5
Worth  - only android phone which replaces iPhone's performance	5
No words to say.. XTREMELY SUPERB	5
best android .	5
Picture quality	5
Very beutiful device i got with cheapest price...!!!	5
Great camera quality and performance	5
Best phone!!	5
Was waiting for it since last month... Was totally worth the wait... Beautiful device... Smooth OS.. Excellent battery life coupled with an awesome camera... Thank you OnePlus and Amazon for bringing this awesome device.. #NeverSettle	5
Awesome phone...i miss notification led it was very helpful.	5
Awesome mobile......very nice camera and shoots good quality pictures. Very long battery life also. Battery charging is very fast	5
One of the best Android Cameras after Pixel.Good and clear sound quality.Smooth display.Fingerprint and face scanner good but slow.Battery easily lasts a day in with heavy usage.No headphone jack so can't charge and use earphones at the same time.	4
Havent got earphone even by pre booking	4
Great	5
Picture quality and sound quality  is  very good . The battery life is better compared to 6  and it will easily last for a day	5
1.All Picture are  very nature.2. Battery is Superb.3. But sound Quality is Little bit Louder even it was good.4. face unlock is too fast and gud.5. performance too gud .	5
My phone after purchase of few days only started hanging while clicking pictures which was not accepted on 6tNot sure weather it will continue later on as well or notElse all other features are excellent	4
I purchased a 6GB, 128GB phone. I m using the dual camera lens for the first time and noticed some objects getting out of focus in the auto mode. Sound quality is same as before with very little improvement. However, OLED display is certainly good with natural colors. The phone came with pre attached screen guard which absorbs lot of prints requiring frequent cleaning. In screen fingerprint sensor works fine. I have always bought one plus as their phones are fast and don't lag like Samsung/Iphone	5
Totally disappointed fingerprint sensor. Headphone jack is necessary one. Go for one plus 6. My suggestion.	3
Finally I moved from iOS to android and oneplus was my first choice .amazon did a fast delivery.Well I will start with what I feel I didnt like ....1) speaker is not good ....from iPhone coming to oneplus flagship u need much more better speakerOther than this I am happy with the phone till now as this is my second day of useMany feel headphone jack abscence is bad well, for me I hardely use them so ok for me . Battery well if you use a week internet then it will drain fast ...at higher speed I saw it was working great 20 minutes of YouTube and 15 minutes of gaming it just dropped 7% . So its okComing to notification light ...it does pops up the notification u need to activate them .Finger print lock ...well if you lift ur finger too fast it wont detect ...otherwise its fast , face unlock is very fast ....face unlock in dark will also work but u need to activate those from settings ....for those who have doubt go to YouTube and see tips for oneplus 6t .a video in 2 parts are there it will help you in all the settingsThere is also option for hidden apps which is great featureCamera is good ,Big phone as I just ditched iPhone 6 so getting adjusted to it .So all over its a great phone , if anyone have any question u can ask me here I will respondThank you	5
Picture Quality : Very GoodCamera : Good.. not very good. Night mode is very goodBattery Life: Its good (i hope its because it is new). I use the mobile throughout the day..(music, internet over 4G and Wifi)	5
Camera is awsome.. All other features oxygen customizations awsome..	5
Best phone of the year.. no one can beat one plus 6t at this price..  Apart from huwaei mat pro 20, no phone can perform better than one plus 6t	5
Simply fantabulous.  Switched from #apple to #oneplus6t	5
Finger sensor is not good	3
Simply an overrated phone. It should cost between 24-26K. Average Camera quality.	3
Nothing	5
My first switch to Android from IOS and I must admit I am pleasantly surprised It's an amazing phone with a rock solid build and a long lasting battery .Very happy with this purchase.Delivery by Amazon was right on time .	5
Oneplus 6t is all "what a student want"	5
Mobile is good but I haven't received the ear Phone though I have bought the pre order.please do the needful	4
U cannot xpect better from a phone than this.. a perfct combo of technology n beauty. Awsome performance!!!	5
Awesome mobile phone good battery pikcup and picture quality ,sound quailty...and Amazon service so good time to delivered .	5
Awesome phone .. worth an upgrade from 2 plus old flagships	5
Purchased with great excitement but disappointed the day i got this phone.. Being a flagship killer, i never expected this phone to face heat issues even with a normal usage..the same problem didn't arise with my brother's phone which he took on the same day... Apps didn't download but some how solved that issue later.. And now some apps are force closing and not working.. Remaining features live upto the mark. But being a oneplus fan, my expectations were sky-high about the 6t..slightly disappointed but not a big deal.. Can adjust with this.	3
Very good	4
Blazingly fast. On par with other flagship devices.	5
Best	4
Very good phone at good price	5
6T is an amazing phone, it is not only very fast but Oxygen OS makes it quiet user friendly. Camera is quiet good. Premium phone at affordable price.	5
Nice phone	4
Best mobile ever very good picture quality good battery and great performance great build quality No any lags no any heating issues it just not a phone  it is  a power machine I play pubg with bullets wireless and no any issue for without headphone jack & overall great phone	5
My mobile is getting unlocked just by swiping up even I didn't add my face data when I enabled pin as my screen lock option	2
Terrific product from OnePlus brand, it's been awesome to use it	5
Great device suggesting this to everyone	4
Good	4
The picture quality, sound quality, overall performance and more that that it is so fast and smooth. I was a Samsung user. Now a big big fan of Oneplus ..6T is just awesome. Just hit it. Better worth the purchase. Simply amazing and perfect delivery by Amazon.	5
Amazing Phone..loved it...	5
This beast has it all!Pros:-Excellent display (blacks are pretty pretty deep! <3)-Outstanding Camera (captures amazing slow-mo videos with ease, clicks great indoor, outdoor and portrait photos!)-unexpectedly loud bottom speaker!(even though it's a single speaker)-Fingerprint scanner(in-display) works perfectly fine!-Face unlock works faster than ever-OxygenOS clearly outshines all the other skins out there!-premium build quality!Cons:-no headphone jack-no notification LEDClearly, the pros outnumber the cons! This the best phone you can get in this price segment! So go for it!	5
This Phone is like a dream phone. Its a bit heavy on the price but damn is it worth it. I had used a OnePlus 3 earlier and i found this is a worthy upgrade. The new bigger battery can last an entire day with still 20% juice left in it. The indisplay fingerprint sensor is upto mark though not that quick with the traditional one, but it sure does the job efficiently.	5
Amazing ExperienceOnly the in-display fingerprint scanner is little slow.Rest all is excellent.	5
Got the delivery next day.Phone is blazing fastAwesome displayIn display fingerprint scanner is just great.Camera is awesome as always. I wish they could have included wide angle camera.Look and feel of the device is just great.Got a great discounts on overall value.	5
Awesome productOnly thing is battery is getting drained a bit fastAnd the sound quality is a bit less	5
The phone is what is advertised, the Night Mode is pretty bad on this phone. But you can fix that by using the pixel cameras port apk	5
Good phone	4
Phone is charging very slow. In 50 mins, itd just 60%	2
6T, it's disappointed me. Moved from 5t. Not worth to move.	3
My Amazfit BipUnable to use hangup/ignore features. The phone keeps ringing even after pressing hangup from the watch.	5
Front focus disappointed	5
This phone is power packed with a 3700 mAh battery which is more than enough to last a day on full charge. The camera is simply the best one I've seen on a mobile device and Nightscape is another cherry on top. The low light photos are amazing, if you manage to stabilize your phone well.Much satisfied with the purchase!	5
This phone has a lot of features from its water drop notch to its bottom thin chin	5
Nice phone very smoothly running	5
I wish it would have filters in camera..	4
Purchased the One Plus 6T from Amazon yesterday.It's a great smartphone, a flagship killer. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:1) Great super AMOLED display, with high screen to aspect ratio and notch hiding option.2) Good camera with life like colours, with OIS/EIS making video shooting stable.3)Good battery life.4) Fast processor and an easy to use OS, with no unnecessary bloatware.5) Charging is fast and hassle free, like all One Plus phones.6) Fingerprint and face unlock is simultaneous, and reasonably fast.7) Absence of notification light is not missed, rather it's a blessing in disguise !Cons:1) Too heavy, fingers hurt after holding it for some time.2) Screen flash for the selfie camera takes lighted, but grainy photos in pitch darkness. The Vivo V11 Pro selfie camera also uses screen flash,but the photos are less grainy.3) Poor ring tone selection, you have to download ring tones.4) No in built FM radio.5) Good sound output, but mono non stereo sound coming from 1 speaker.6) Potrait mode / Bokeh effect snaps are just average, both for the front and rear cameras, background contrast is poor and uneven. The Vivo V11 Pro takes better potrait photos.7) Mirror black version and the plastic cover is prone to fingerprint smudges and attracts dust. It has to be wiped regularly with a cloth.As you can see however, the cons are nothing major, and overall,its a great value-for-money phone!	4
Good for the price	5
Have been using the phone from last 3 days till now it looks amazing and speed is super fast. Only drwaback I find is the fingerprint sensor.	5
Good	5
The whole product is good but 36k is more for it	1
This is an amazing phone! I purchased it and got it in 3 days. Amazing battery life and sound quality too. Provides better quality than an iPhone.	5
One of the phone...	5
I got a faulty product and Ive been kept on the hook for more than 7 days without any solution.	4
I am noticing some phone issues, the other side of the party not able to hear the intiial few seconds.. if the issue persists perhaps return.	4
After using 1 week , camera hang many times, camera app crash many times and restart.not accepting this this from one plus phone.battry life is also not good.except this picture quality is good.	4
I recently bought one plus6t. After two days of use it's got started hanging. I didn't downloaded any thing,storages is also free.Picture quality is average when compared to other low budget phones in the market.Finger print unlock is slower then face unlock.Audio quality is very poor, low mids are clashing.Phone is not up to the mark.	2
Upgraded from OnePlus 5T1. Battery Life Has Improved a lot thanks for the upgrade OnePlus.2. Camera Quality has improved, I was missing the OIS but now nothing to Worry.3. The Water Droplet Notch is not a Hindrance at all. The display quality is what one should be.4. After the last Update the Screen Unlock Has become Even Faster. I really don't find a difference in the speed between the Physical Finger print scanner and this Indisplay one. It's equally Fast.5. The Speaker even after being a Mono Gives Really Good Listening experience.6. OVER ALL A MUST BUY / UPGRADE.	5
It is excellent	5
HiThis is to inform you that I am facing an issue with fingerprint sensor.When l am trying to set fingerprint password getting a message"partial fingerprint detected please completely cover the identification area".I have also called the onepluscare and have tried all possible ways to overcome this problem as discussed by onepluscare agent.should I return this device or is there any other solution, please revert me asap with best one.Thanks	4
Love the premium finish and top notch features. Timely delivery from Amazon. Super fast faceunlock and onscreen finger print scanner is a cool and fast. My 3rd OnePlus after 1 and 3T..	5
The phone is awesome.. the onle problem is my adapter doesn't work and Amazon has promised to replace the whole set.. hopefully it works on well	5
Box was damaged andScreensaver is not workingPlz help me with that	5
I like every feature and design. But, we need required headset for this device. Better to give free headset in the box.	5
Ultimate phone to buy in this range..	5
Loving it	5
Sound quality is a little poor when compared to any premium phone for example apple iphone	4
Picture, sound and speed	5
Buy at your own risk..it can't even survive one single drop on the floor...and the back panel will cost you 2k rupees ..God knows how much if screen damage.	2
Nice awesome phone. Camera clarity is chanceless. Face unlock and indisplay finger sensor is working fine. Dual speakers r rocking.	5
Awesome phone with a great processor	5
So good Phone one	5
Best phone	5
Camera was amazing, sound they given 2 speakers in bottom of the phone but in that only one speaker is working another one no sounds I heard. Batter life little good then oneplus6. Totally nice phone in this budget.	4
Everything about the phobe is great but Indian prices have jumped up. I am in love with the phone. The packaging quality should improve as no one wants their phone retail box to be distorted when the phone is delivered	5
With the latest update which I received yesterday. Battery life is simply superb. Nightscape is superb	5
A perfect phone till this date	5
Really good phone I have upgraded from op5 and fully satisfied and really fast and speed "PLEASE TRY  TO UNLOCK THE SPEED"	5
Almost perfect but connecting earphones while call does not does not collect our voice we have to be very close to mic	5
Simply unique	5
I am huge fan of OnePlus.I have upgraded from 3T to 6T. This phone is incredibly fast than other devices I used.	5
Loved it!	5
Best in class, camera is awesome. And while playing pubg there was zero lag and the graphics at it's highest still didn't heat up the device. But battery management is weak, 4hrs of regular usage got me 34% from full charge.	5
Sound could be better, battery can be little bigger, no headphone jack	5
Day night pic osm sounds is good battery life far. Good compair to my s9 plus	5
Excellent	5
It's wonderful product of one plus .Battery back up is amazing .nice design	5
It is just another phone one plus have produced. Can say flawless.Pros:DisplayPerformanceLow light photography using nightscapeCameraBattery lifeConsOff course no headphone jack ( I have been using for a week and still finding difficult to carry typeC to headphone cable)Price could have been 2-3K lesser	5
Mind blowing speed and picture quality	5
Ear phones were not included in box that's the thing I disliked the most	5
The 6t is good and fast. However, the functioning of fingerprint scanner is suboptimal.	4
Very good phone	5
No memory card option. Otherwise Perfect & Awesome.	5
Excellent phone.	5
Worth to buy.	5
No comparison with any phone, the best of all	5
excellent	5
Camera quality should improve. Pics are not reality, looks like painted	5
One plus is really awesome ... The features picture clarity is reall good , And one plus 6 8gb 128 is super fast and great performance ....I really like one plus 6t is all d aspects....	5
I like everything in this phone except camera picture quality specially in night when I use flash I can sell white thing like smoke in the picture. I called Amazon let's see what they'll do	3
All points are awesome just the battery life is not good	5
Awesome product , Awesome Price.	5
the fastest i've used, the OS is responsive as advertised	5
Sound quality needs to improve..need Equalizer settings which are missing in all OnePlus models	5
It's really a premium smart phone with all the latest features you could ever ask for. Camera quality is superb, especially night mode.Photos was taken in full dark night.Just one word. Best	5
Amazing Performance and really good battery lifeLove this phone	4
OnePlus you rocked it screen,camera,sounds,looks all are amazing ..please provide in built music player	5
Undoubtedly the Killer	5
Great phone	5
I purchased this one n get it on monday. However I am completely dissatisfied with the performance. The way OnePlus advertised this 6T is not at all matching what it delivers now. The "picture quality" is not at all even good. Even on 10% zoom the picture pixel breaks completely. Currently I am using a nexus 5X. I compared the picture taken in nexus 5x to that of 6T and the result is - picture taken in nexus 5x is way more better then this 6T.Next I charged the phone 75% didn't even use for anything coz till now I didn't configure my phone completely(still using nexus for most of work) then by evening the battery dropped to 47%. Hardly I had 2 call of max 5min.The screen resolution is also not quite satisfactory. Oneplus says it's optic amoled but when compared to the resolution of Samsung S8 the resolution in 6T not looks like that of an optic amoled display.Completely waste of money if you purchase it just watching the advertisement and specifications... Instead I would suggest to go for Samsung S8+,S8 or pixel 2xl in almost same range.	2
Slowmosion is not working.but mobile us good.	5
It is a excellent mobile with marvelous features.	5
Good phone but price is too high in comparison to market. Fast as told camera upto mark same as 6 it should be improved.	5
Unlock the speed	5
Its amazing phone ....that's why it comes in best premium category cell phone in India 2018....10 on 10 ....and thanks for Amazon for prompt and unexpected delivery.....	5
Amazing phone.....	5
It's Everything is better battery backup is a small dissappoint	5
BEAST........ "that's all you need to know"	5
Nice	4
Simply superb.. no words.	5
Awesome phone Battery back up is really good	5
Nice phone but new screen is adopted by most of the apps. You can find green color at the edges when you open the app	5
After having used one plus 2(still using) past 3 years, I just fell in love for one plus phones.their performance and build quality are superior. I just wanted to upgrade and waited to buy 6T since one plus 6 is being talked about.I did know that 6T should be there any time soon.And finally got this elegant beast!Have been using past two days.. trust me, it's a killer of the lot.Superior user experience.Great face recognition, even in low lightFinger print sensor is super fastAwesome smooth graphics..App drawer, App switching etc.Negligible Bezel , Will create more screen spaceMidnight Black suggested, for  lesser fingerprint marks.Battery life is great,with dash charge	5
My first OnePlus device and I am already liking it. After so many recommendations from family and friends, I finally bought OnePlus 6T this time and it's an amazing phone. No heating issues, awesome battery and best of the screen display. I was little skeptical about the size of the phone, I like small handy phones but though its a long phone but in-hand feel is very good due to 19:5:9 aspect ratio the width of the phone is little less so you feel comfortable with the phone.  I definitely recommend this phone. One of the best Android phone in the market. Bye Bye Samsungs and Mis ;)	5
Vibrant display,decent look,excellent camera and battery backup,smooth performance.pnly cons are its not up rated and sterio sound.	4
Ordered on 3rd Nov received on 4th morning. The phone looks premium. The design and build quality is top. The screen looks beautiful with the water drop notch. The camera seems to be same as one+6. Battery life is awesome day/ more than a day in single charge for normal/ medium usage. They have dash charge which charges from 20-100 in almost 1 hr. They shud have provided a wireless charger.. The oneplus launcher is not that great. Sound quality is good woth speaker and on earpiece. The inbuild fingerprint scanner works good. But if used other launcher its a bit milliseconds slower. The backside finish is mirror glass and is too slippery and attracts lots of fingerprints so one shud get a cover.Overall a good phone but the price could have been on bit lower side. 38k is on higher side. One should also consider Xiaomi mi mix3 it does have a wireless charger too.	5
Very nice	5
Very nice phone	4
Outstanding phone,blown away,but need improvement in selfie camera and battery.otherwise unbelievable item.	5
Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow (just a bit). Phone charges very rapidly ( 38% to 78% in just 23 mins). Camera is alright, could be better (Portrait mode is really good).	4
Good	4
After using Moto Z play for 2 years,now I am a proud owner of this great mobile 6t.One of the greatest phone I ever used......	5
Loving it	4
Wow just wow	5
Phone is good. However bit heavy to hold. Should have included earphones with the box. One plus, pls don't follow apple way to buy accessories by paying extra, standard accessories shud come with the box. Happy to see day u at least provided type c connector.	5
No dislikes for this phoneEverything is fantastic	5
Thiss phone is unbelievable. Purchased just after launched.Good budget phone. Go for it guyss.	5
Fingerprint scanner like does not works at all, so slow n many time it doesn't open also	4
It's a wonderful product with high standards of performance in everyway. It looks premium and works great too. Only problem is finger print censor is slow. Needs more work.	4
If you are planning to buy a phone. Go for it. Delivery is within 3 days.	5
Missing headphone jack and notification led is big trouble.. Especially if you were using oneplus before.. Fingerprints scanner is slow and doesn't works as smoothly as in 3T or 5.. Better to go for oneplus 6 or wait till oneplus corrects it blunders in oneplus 6T.	3
This phone is amazing . Camera is good , battery is good and it charges completly in 50 min. Though it have single speaker but its very lound  and sound quality is awesome. Happy with the purchase. In short , it feels very premium with the waterdrop notch.	5
It's one the best smartphone I ever have used.Thank you Oneplus for this amazing phone and Amazon too for their services.	5
Camera pics are not having good quality. Pixel is not clear	1
Such a nice phone... Good speed good cams and nice audio out...	5

The discount could have been more	1
It's my first OnePlus phone. Phone is amazing and performance is outstanding. Overall super Speed phone.	5
Awesome performance,super fast os, battery is great,face unlock is blazing fast. Both cameras areamazing. Try Google pixel 3 camera port (download from XDA developer website) for  best night shots.Sound quality is okay, could have come with stereo speaker. Overall a big thumbs up.	5

I was using OnePlus 3t for the past two years...3t was a excellent one..so want to go for the new one and bought 6t..Pro:1.Battery is reasonably good.2.No lags3.Almost stock android experience..4.As usual fast and smooth..5.available with back cover and scratch guard..so no need to spend extra6.looks premiumCons1.Removal of conventional headphone jack..remember it is not completely removed but can be used via converter2.display seems to be very dull..I don't know why but may be due to battery saving technique ..3.no led notification4.one handed operation is difficult ..5.camera is big let down..with all the hype I thought the camera is going to be good but it's not .very worst..don't even think about comparing the pictures of iPhone , s9+ and pixel with this one..	4
Amazing superb phone I m speech less about this outstanding performance	5
Phone is not working after update.I need immediate replacement or need my money back without further delay.	1
Awesome camera, very fast and dash charge killing it. Fingerprint sensor very classy... Truly unlocking the speed	5
Picture and sound quality are super but battery life is worst	4

38000 price not good	1
I bought Oneplus 6T (128GB)Gorgeous display and blazing fast performance.Pros:-Literally everything about this phone is outstandingCons:-Selfie camera could've been better and fingerprint unlock is quite slow. I hope these two things will work even better and faster in future updates.	5
It was just awesome experience this time! ThankYou Amazon! ThankYou Oneplus!	5

Awesome product!	5
Its a good phone	4
so this was my first oneplus device and I was expecting a lot for it ,after using it for 7 days here is its honest reviewPros.amazing speed amazing with fast charging and very clean OSspeakers are too damn goodthe inbuilt fingerprint sensor is very fast and looks pretty cool so is the face unlockreally premium look and solid builtGorilla glass 6 protectionCons nightscape mode doesn't work as fine when compared to pixel 3 XL or what has been show at that launch again the camera is just average but really better than poco f1 but not as good as pixel 3xl ,but it works fine3.5 mm headphone jack is missing but don't worry you won't miss him that much the type C headphones are quite amazingsomeone's are found When You oxygen OS but oneplus will remove them very quicklyVerdict : go for it it's the best phone in price range and I would say it's far better than poco F1.Don't think twice ,get this device	5
It's Really good phone to daily routine people's ...Easy & Quick Charge in this phone	5
Awesome phone	5
Picture  quality is normal and PHOTO also normal quality	3
Smooth and fast performance... Camera quality is awesome..	5
The phone is a good phone with excellent battery speed and storage.Finger print is good although during night it emits a fair amount of light which is bright.	5
	5
Picture quality awesome, design awesome,camera awesome, this phone have no negatives. best Android phone.buy it without any second thought.	5
Only one speaker working	5
Delivery speed is f*****ng good . Got delivered in just one day to almost to a remote village. Thanks Amazon. Coming to phone a big thumps up to the one plus. Liked it in all aspects. Loving it	5
Perfect Phone	5
Phone is really good. But sometimes it gives me feel as if I am using Motorola Phone. But lookwise it's awesome. Overall good experience with OnePlus	5
ProsInsane speed with completely very optimised oxygen OSWaterdrop notch and small chinDisplay is goodBattery life is awesome(7 hours of screen on time)Active Xda developers support for this phoneCharging speed is awesomeOverall design of the phone is awesomeConsCamera is goodIndisplay finger print scanner is not trust worthyNightscape is gimmickLack of headphone jackNo notification led	5
beastly performance and quality top notch specs	5
mobile is very good and fast.but battery is draining like anythg..within two days of usage i found battery consumption is more than my old phone redmi note4	1
Picture quality,sound and battery life is awesome	5
Nice look, good OS, user friendly...Need to improve finger print sensor working...	4
To sum it up in a sentence I would say that it is very fast... The phone responds within a fraction of a second be it calling someone or opening up browser or any application...Icing on the cake is that it does not overheat easily... I played pubg for almost two hours and it never heated up above the normal heat... And the battery consumption was only 25%... Amazing...The fingerprint sensor works 4 out of 5 times... This one might need some improvement or some software updates but it's better than most ones out there... When it works it unlocks in less than a second...Photos at night time came out really good... Day time pictures were crisp and natural... Need to check other modes as well when I get the chance...	5
Just Love the screen and its quality...oneplus is doing it again!!	5
Why the 6gb ram128 GB is not available in midnight black...	5
Superb phone & service	5
Good one not bad.	5
Best thing I switched to was using Samsung s8+ but really 6t surprised me a lot premium phoneNight pic is so awesome even it looks like DSLRBattery is really goodAnd on screen finger print is so fastThanks one plus !!!	5

Excellent Product	4
Delivery was way fast. And product is awesome. It can't be described in words. you have to feel it.	5
It's an amazing phone..	5
Good phone but inbuilt finger sensor not working properly needs improvement	4
Wow awesome device fully satisfied about the performance  	5
Very nice	5
Amazing Phone ...	5
Everything is awesome in this fone no issue faced.. battery last whole day...	5
One Of the best phone in Maket For this  Price.	5
The main selling point of 6T has been the Indisplay fingerprint scanner, but to my dismay, I found that, it is not at all fast and does not recognize my fingerprint 95% of the times. I deleted my fingerprint and set it up again multiple times, still no improvement.Every other aspect about this phone is excellent, but then again, the fingerprint scanner is a total disaster from my week long experience with this product. Something has to be done about this, or I need a new phone	3
With this price, you get a smooth operating device and the notch display is class apart.Beautiful integration of features to say the least, the fingerprint sensor on the display makes it even more dynamic.Well I do miss the headphone jack but type C adapter makes up for it, also it is the way forward where i believe i would be using Bluetooth headsets in near future.Camera is the most stable camera i have seen till date, Nightscape mode indeed provides you with better options for low-light photography.Gaming mode is another X-factor about this phone, I mean WOW ! Oxygen OS allows the phone to just flow like a fluid. Couldn't have asked for anything better. It's worth an investment and at some point i also feel so many upgrades at this range is as good as a bargain.	5
Picture Quality and display	5
	5
This is a real flagship device...U will truly like it...it's really the most fastest......NOT MORE TO SAY..U KNOW ITS ONE PLUS(FEEL THE POWER)	5
Awesome sound and picture quality I really love it	5
Best phone,every things & thanks awesome	5
Absolutely loved the phone.Got it delivered within two days without prime.Amazing camera. So Seamless experience. Sweet Android 9. Battery could be a bit long lasting but dash charging takes care of that.	5
Dont think go for it best phone at this range nd gives a premium feeling, Before Oneplus I was using iphone SE but belive me this is the best phone no Iphone can complete this phone at this rate	5
I was disappointed that 256G variant was out of stock and I had to settle for 128G model. There could have been a book model not available which could have extended the offer which was otherwise expiring on Nov-03 2018.	5
Good phone	5
I extremely satisfied with this OnePlus 6T, awesome product with great features. It's all above my expectations.	5
Not as excellent as expected	5
The phone is ultra fast with all features intact and yes its meets the expectation always.Oneplus has made again an awesome phone..well pleased with the phone i recieved .Dont think about it much buy it.	5
Picture perfect... battery is good..I think sounds is little bit low	5
It's a great phone. Don't buy it if you have a one plus 6	5
The finger print sensor on the screen is pathetic.The weight of the device is an issue.I am not happy... Its juz ok kinds..Will recommend not to buy...	3
You can't complain about the speed. Battery drain day if you're gaming so 3 stars. But the thing charges as quickly. You can't go won't with this purchase. How it will hold over time is something I'll have to wait for. But build quality seems good for the price.	5
This phone is beast. Only issue is that it cuts a very small areas in the edges. Hardly noticeable while watching videos but you will Nordic it while playing pubg.	5
Truely an amazing phone. Wanted to post the review after 1 day of use but was unable to do so because of some technical glitch at Amazon's end.1 - Battery - Its very good as it lasts approximately 30-32 hours including 2 hours of music playback on Amazon Prime through Bluetooth, decent number of calls, 4G VoLTE on through out the duration.2 - Camera - Not spectacular or something but overall good. In natural daylight the pics are amazing, but during night time in the night mode the pics look a bit artificial because of the saturation and lighting. Slow video recording is amazing. Front Camera is good enough and comes with a screen flash.3 - Screen & Notch - The display is simply amazing with an option to hide the notch manually. The bezels at the bottom are bit thick and could have been thinner. the viewing angles are amazing.4 - Sound - The sound is a feature which disappointed me in this phone. No doubt it is loud but the treble is not good. It lacks clarity. May be there would be changes over time.5 - Charging - This is simply out of the world. The Dash Charge is superb and it charges the phone from 46-100% in approx 35 mins.6 - In Display Fingerprint scanner - It is very accurate and takes a bit of time to calibrate. It is a bit slow as compared to the conventional fingerprint scanners.7 - Face Unlock - Its outstanding. It unlocks the phone the moment you look at the screen when the screen is on. It is secure also as it doesn't unlock the phone if your eyes are closed.Overall - Its an amazing phone and a must buy at this price and given the specs. Other companies trying to troll this by showing off their low prices can never match with the quality. And they also provide a back case along with it which is cool enough as you don't have to search for one.	5
One plus did not give us Color options. Even Apple has 5 different Color options now. OnePlus should learn from Apple and vivo on how to use gradient Colors.Camera is average. Apple XS is much better in terms of camera. In my opinion guys don't buy this phone. Go for Apple.	1
First of all Thanks Amazon for sending it on Time but upset that unable to club the offer of free ear phones with no cost emi.It's my first one plus phone so there was excitement.Phone is fast n furious no doubt . Simple and easy to used. Picture quality is amazing . Earpiece volume is low . Comparatively low for both ear piece . Don't have interest in gaming so can't tell about gaming. Company fitted scratcguard is of not that great quality. It got scractes on first day used. No music player App apart from Google play. Battery life is good .I am heavy internet user so Battery life is awesome. So it's half review. Probably after one month I can tell you about final review.	4
Awesome phone love it	5
I shifted from Apple back to Android and boy oneplus didn't disappoint at all. Superior display, love the new dynamic fingerprunt, games run exquisitely well. Camera is good, selfie is a bit shaky and nights cape can be improved. 9/10 rating overall to the ohone.	5
Been 3 days using the phone and it is a gem. Specs are great. Fingerprint sensor slower than usual I feel but can't complain. In short for the price, it is the best phone out there! Will recommend without any hesitation.	5
Improve battery life	5
Awesome fone must buy	5
ordered this phone for my brother and trust me it's really good at the price point!!	5
Worst product not even that much worth that it costs waste of money	1
Brightness is very low. I was using OnePlus 5. 20% of brightness in OnePlus 5 is equal to 65% brightness in 6T which may cause  in draining the battery. Not happy with it. Also unlocking with fingerprint is not up to the mark. Totally not so happy with it. Thinking to return it and use OnePlus 5 only	1
Awesome phone battery life is excellent pictures quality is superb but I disappointed by after clicking pictures photo only one time zoom	5
This is an awesome experience with OnePlus ! Overall an awesome phone with a lightning speed of everything, including charging and performance. Awesome amoled display, only problem with the Mirror black colour which leaves fingerprint residues at back. Other than it, all is fine.	5
I was extremely excited about the product and while I prefer ordered through Amazon gift card and bought it on the launch day. I was extremely dissapointed with Amazon. During the sale the offer showed 3/6 month no cost emi and then when I went ahead with 6 months my bank started to charge 13% interest saying we have already given no cost emi discount and now 13% will be applicable. Don't understand the logical behind it, if you are giving a discount why do you find ways to earn it back with false advertisement. Now, the offer has changed and says that's applicable only for 3 months. This really messed up my experience. I have been a one plus user and purchased the same through Amazon on multiple occasion, dissapointed to see the quality and commitment has gone so down so much.	2
Addin' a dash of Glitter to Diwali'18 with great pomp 'n fervour is OP6T. #NeverSettle #UnlockTheSpeed #DewDropNotch #InDisplayFPScanner #HappyMe	5
Worth it	4
This device is clearly ahead of its pack for the hardware and features provided in this price range. Since everyone is well aware of the specs I'll just provide my experience while using this device.1. Sharp well balanced pictures during daytime and nightscape mode does a decent effort to reduce graininess and camera shake while taking night shots with low ISO settings. Still room for improvement though.2. As for sound quality I never use phone speakers while listening to music and prefer my Bluetooth headphones as I hate wires. I'm glad headphone jack is absent. One less vestigial organ to worry about as we move forward. Thank you oneplus. Call clarity is good as expected.3. Marriage of bloatfree oxygen os alongwith snapdragon 845 makes this phone a pure joy to use. Fast snappy and responsive! In screen fingerprint sensor though takes more time to unlock than the physical one at the back earlier, but this has been hid well by the animations provided.4. Battery life is excellent and I'm using dark theme which further reduces battery consumption. Gives me more than one day of usage without playing any games.5. Body has been exquisitely crafted and with the gorilla 6 screen and teardrop notch this is one of  the best displays you can get at present. I would have still preferred a metal unibody instead of the glass back though.All in all I would say you'd feel proud and satisfied to own this device. If you can shell out the extra dough go for the 8 gb versions. Thumbs up to Oneplus for another great product and for not "settling" !	5
Everything in this mobile is excellent except the indisplay fingerprint scanner is little bit slower as compared to physical fingerprint scanner	5
AS EXPECTED.POWERFULL WEAPON	5
First time buyer of One Plus and its awesome. Phone performance is good, very much liked the speed and camera.	5
Nice but!	5
Picture quality is good but sound quality would have been still better	5
Best phone launched by oneplus	5
Nice product	5
OnePlus 6t is an amazing phone but the worst is Amazon service. I had prebooked the OnePlus 6t on 26th of October and was entitled for the free earphones and 500 Amazon cash back. The worst part is they allow to buy gift card more than one and while booking it is limited toonly one unit per ID. So to order the phone I had to use another ID. Now I got to know that I'm not entitled to get the preorder promotions.The question arises is why they allow to purchase 2 gift cards and redeem only one.	1
The picture quality is so good	5
Best phone to use....The super phone!...	5
First of all thnx Amazon for Fast delivery.Picture Quality Best.Sound Quality Best.Battery life found little bit low.What I most likely is Face unlock feature it's very fast than finger print.3.5 mm audio jack is a not issue I think.Over all I am very happy with this phone	5
I have been waiting for OnePlus 6t for about 3-4 months. I already made up my mind that i will buy this phone only and that decision was the best.Using this phone for 2-3 days only but i have seen-:amazing picture qualityBooming soundSmooth as butter operationsAmazing processing speedAwesome battery lifeLightning speed chargingAnd the list goes on...........The thing which i was a little disappointed are -:Missing 3.5 mm jack (they will give you a converter though and many of us now have Bluetooth earphones)In screen fingerprint sensor is not very fast it still need regular software updatesBut all and all amazing phone and must buy	5
BEST PHONE UNDER 40K* NOTCH IS TINY & CUTE *IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT IS FAST. PLEASE DONT BELEIVE RUMORS THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO GET USE TO..*CAMERA IS GOOD NO COMPLAINTS ( GCAM PORTED FOR 6T) SO WE ARE READY TO ROCK*BATTERY LAST A DAY ( WHO CARES ABOUT BATTERY WHEN DASH CHARGE IS AVAILABLE )*NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT DISPLAY ITS AMOLED  (NO SCREEN BLEED ISSUE )*IMPROVED OXYGEN OS THIS TIME MORE POLISHED & MORE FLUID. GESTURE CONTROL IS NOW NEGATIVES :* ONLY ONE SPEAKER  WHILE PLAYING GAME IT GETTING BLOCKED EASILY*NO 3.5 JACK.. I KNOW FUTURE WILL GO WIRELESS. BUT WE ARE NOT READY SO SURELY WE WILL MISS THE AUDIO JACK 	5
Good	4
On the screen guard there were few scratches. Headphone was also not there. Also noticed today that 2nd sim is not working. When complained on 8Nov18, Mr. Sunil from Amazon informed that it will be replaced today 9Nov18 between 10 to 11 am. When called up Amazon at around 12 O clock, came to know by surprise that my delivery address has been deactivated reason not know to any one hence the same is not yet replaced. Is this some kind of harassment so that the defective product is not replaced? If the same is not replaced by today evening then I will have to take this up with the higher authority, please note.	5
Picture quality sound qulity is better bit this mobile some dispute mobile doesn't proper working issue working time mobile hang and display showing only white and black color not working plz replacmeant this mobile one plus 6t	3

Delivered by 4th day awesome phone feels premium 5star no need to explain its oneplus community ...price is very smart	5
Every features on the 6t is really amazing loved it . But improvements can be made in the in-display screen unlock through software updation.	5
The phone is very good as compared to iphone I was using earlier that too at half of the price.. just need to know when we will get Type C bullet earphones	5
Excellent Phone..	5
Amazing phone... Superb picture quality......	5
Mobile is good but they give me a faulty camera which takes photos poor that one plus 2 and then they are not ready to replace, it is one case in thousands but it should be addressed. Worst service by Amazon	4
Only one word attttt	5
Best phone and camera quality is awesome and delivered by Amazon in 2 days very nice	4
It's an awesome product.i am big fan of OnePlus mobiles.best fone in 2018 to 2019	5
Coming from OnePlus 3T, This is such an awesome phone.1. 8hrs Screen on Time (Never crossed 4 to 5hrs in OP3T - even when it was new)2. Awesome Display3. Excellent Camera4. Amazing speed and responsiveness.5. Near stock OS experience, with very good and useful add-ons.6. 10% to 80% charge in about 35-40 mins max.7. Bundled USB C-Type to Stereo pin converter works perfectly, but my CrossBeats Wave Bluetooth headphone is doing wonders with PowerAmp Player.and Lot more.. After considering all launch offers and also with 128GB base variant, this is either equivalent or better priced than OnePlus 6.	5
AS I HAD ALREADY CUSTOMER OF ONE PLUS 5,IAM VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WITH PACKING MATERIAL OF ONE PLUS 6T, I COMPARE BOTH BOXES OF ONE PLUS 5 AND 6TWHEN I PICK MY NEW PHONE 6T,I FOUND MATERIAL USED IS VERY DULL,MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS 0BUT OVERALL PHONE IS WORKING WELL WITH LESS BATTERY BACKUP	5
Good camera and excellent performance	5
Speaker should be improved	5
Nice One	5
Noooo	5
Phone have many feautures... i Like it...	5
I m glad that i joined the OnePlus community. The phone is best phone till now.	5

Just amazing.	5
Camera flash is not workingDisappointed from One + 6T ....	1
Picture quality is very nice	5
Fast charging, long last battery, awesome camera, excellent speed, perfect for gamers...and speakers in the phone are very loud ( some times its iritate)..Everything is perfect.. i am happy and i love it	5
Sound quality is not that good as I cannot here ringtone while in pocket.Battery life is average considering my usage.Camera is pretty cool with the new night mode and I liked the camera very much (selfie is not up to the mark as expected)Performance is lit , no issues with it.	5
Awesome mobile. You won't regret after buying it except for battery.Battery discharges very fast. One plus guys plz do something for this.	4
Best phone	5
Better became the bestEverything is fine and neat but the camera department on the whole should have been improve Avg Camera and its not worth a upgrade from 6 or even from a 5t.Battery in this is beast nearly 7 hr 30min screen on tym since first charge that tok till 96% oly I charged.	4
Worth every penny	5
Auto rotate screen option not working. While I off the auto rotate option. Even though it's keep rotating. After I spend lots of money 39k such premier flag ship ...not given value for money	3
This phone is perfect.OS is amazing.Camera is perfect.Sound quality wity stereo speakers or dual speakers it's amazing.Removal of headphone jack sometimes is a struggle.	5
It's amazing to use one plus 6t . It's really user friendly phone .	4
Oneplus has once again delivered a great phone. But this time the upgrade was not as much expected. But anyways this phone is also stunning and beutifulPros: Crisp nd clear display  Buttery smooth performance  Gr8 camera  Full day long battery  Dash chargeCons : no headphone jack  Not so loud speaker	5
Excellent successor to one plus 6	5
Too pricey for the specs	4
Pros:+Zero lag , great battery 5*+camera is superb as similar to previous version, though has some soft upgrades. 5*+Dash Charging is super cool. 5*+Display is the best you can get for this price range! 4*+S845 is undoubtedly powerful and apps load and work seamlessly 5*+Great gaming experience ( with not much of heating issue & battery drain) 5*+Great sound quality (5*)Cons:-Indisplay fingerprint scanner seems not a very useful thing. Its difficult to use it (better go with face unlock). It will be much better only if you add all 10 fingers :-) 3*-Fingerprint scanning is comparatively slow (lot of catchy graphics) and sometimes delayed if a wrong finger was used. 2*-Using without a cover is too risky - the back cover is very slippery . But using a cover the phone looses its identity though.-No AUX port, though a type-C to AUX cable is provided with the pack, carrying it all the time is difficult .overall, its a very nice phone and I'm just getting used to it. So far so good.	4
Everything is worth loving.	5
This is my 1st one plus mobile its amazing I happy, camera shoot low light best.	5
No 1mobile	2
Awesome mobile...... Haven't slept since using this mobile from 2 days.... Wow man. Loved it	5

Good product!	5
It's awesome all	5
Battery life is much longer than oneplus 3T. Picture quality is just awesome. Pro phone...make me feel royal when i take it into hand. Love oneplus.	5
Superb Phone but you miss the chance to unbox when you order it online as the delivery boy will unbox it by himself to compete the procedure. Great Phone Value for money.	5
Well just received it one day back.Experience is smooth. Software update is very frequently. Got two update since now.On screen fingerprint scanner improved from last update i guess.Camera is super good, but need more software update for portrait mode and nigh mode. Its looks like they changed the name of hdr mode to night mode. Nigh mode is useless.Face unlock is really good. Sound is also really good, didn't test the earphone. For normal users the battery will last almost 36hrs with dual 4g on. Dash charger is charging it really quickly. Still testing.	5
I wanted to buy a economical phone with best camera for video capturing.This was my fantastic choice as the 4K recording is simply amazing with best stabilization that i never found in any other phones which are being sold in half the rates.Go for this if you love using camera for especially for video capturing.	5

I am excited with this product OnePlus 6T 6/128. Speed and performance are the beauty of the device. A value for money smartphone for those looking for affordable high end ones.	4
Simply super again from Oneplus	5
The Phone is pretty good,good display,the quality of sound is far better then other phones.The battery life is much better then expected. There is little bit bugs in the phone hopes that it will be removed by next software update.	5
I got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it's a beast. CNET mentioned it as "Hero phone without sky high Price". It's true. At this price range it's a great value for money.  OnePlusen launching amazing phone's and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.Games are running at ultra or high. Haven't hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.Camera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.Amazing UI, appreciation is heartfelt.The build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won't necessarily do that . Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don't have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I'm happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I'm mentioning is already there leave it). In-display FP sensor is faster. I don't have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it's faster than fast-enough.Battery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It's like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.Sound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It's like I'm hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I'm either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.Pricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.Only problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover & case. I couldn't find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days  . So I've ordered 3 of them  let's see which will fit, I'll return the other 2.The protective bumper case is 2k, though it's official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don't say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don't have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product's accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass. Got the promo code and getting the bullets headphone in a day's time. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus.	5
All are good	5
Best phone at this price range.	5
Blindly go for it	5
I was just shifted from OnePlus one to 1+6t ... It's full on beast mode..Every segment of this phone was an A+..I was truly satisfied with what I got..	5
Awesome phone I loved it.	5
Overall phone is awesome fingerprint sensor should be a little fast but it's ok battery life is awesome picture quality is great Dash charging is also awesome just charge your phone for 20 minutes than you can use it for long time with mobile data and GPS on camera is as always great.	5
Value of the money	5
Great product. Value for money	5
But not a good update from Oneplus 6..	5
I just loved the mobile.	5
The product is awesome , a different feel to use the mobile , one problem is battery is not as powerful as one plus 5 , and then although finger print sensor is good to use , at times during night times  it will be affecting your eyes due to excess light produced from it ,  awesome.gaming experience and video watching experience	5
Very Nice phone	5
Great phone even though some features that were there previously are missing. Camera is just superb.Good delivery of product. Reached on time	5
Amazing battery life and a great experience to use it.	5
This is my first OnePlus phone. So far experience is good.	5
It's very early to write a review on a phone( only two days old). I didn't find any issues till now. When it comes to picture quality, good but not excellent (my friends took some photos with my phone they are not happy with the clarity, when it comes to my opinion it doesn't bother me at all because I won't took much photos or selfies) may be gets better by using daily or by upcoming updates.Sound quality:- they give only one speaker and it's good (Tip :- If anyone didn't buyed ctype earphones please buy it as soon as possible because u won't feel comfortable with the 3.5mm dongle)Battery life: 3700mah battery is excellent, but it's very early to give a judgement. As u all know every new phone will be good for some days.	5
I have moved from iPhone 5s to OnePlus 6t. Really fantastic.One immediate comment is that presence of face detection and on display finger print are redundant. Because when face detection is there there is no use of finger print.	5
Pros:Battery life - lasted me more than 24 hours with reasonable usageExcellent Camera. Night mode especially.Sturdy Build qualityFacial recognition works lightning fastBright displayQuick chargePlenty to play around with settings and features.Cons:Fingerprint magnet due to the default screen guard that comes with the phone.The screen catches more fingerprints than the mirror black back side.Fingerprint sensor is not upto the mark. Struggle at times for it to recognize. Takes a  bit longer than expected to recognize.Felt the phone to be a bit heavy. Possibly due to the battery size.	5
Best decision if you really want to go for phone. In terms of camera 5/5 , sound 5/5, battery full day . But when you talk about dash charging half n hour that is the thing which is not true, it took 1.5 hours to charge fully. But that was not a issue. People should go for this phone.	5
Tremindous phone . battery is very good alsopicture qulaity feel mini DSLR Camre	5
Phone is good and phone sound was very good but battery is very bad  I am not satisfied this phone	1
Display Similar to oppo f9 Vivo v9 pro.  Nobody knows what you have in your hand ..... Apple provide you the proud moment that you have Apple in your hand	4
The phone is a flagship killer.. but it too have flaws... After unboxing and using it for an hour the phone started to over heat... Till now it is overheating. Battery standby is also not good.. for normal usage also u have to wrap this phone with a cloth to get use to the heat.. hope this is a software glitch and expext a software update soon which may resolve this issue... Camera quality is nice specially the night mode .	3
Good Battery	4
Sound quality is awesome . Daylight pictures are best , it seems like I had just captured from dslr. Battery life is good.	5
Thanks to optic AMOLED display enjoy full HD movies with better clear and loud sound	5
Picture quality is good. But night scape takes some time for processing. Battery life is super. You will easily get 1 full day. In display finger print is slow sometimes.	5
Picture quality 5	5
I like the product but its price is not justified. Based on its features it's over priced. it's selfy pic is not up to the mark. And even idol mode battery draining heavily. But sound quality is very good in speaker mode.	4
Beast	5
As expected, no department of cons. Only pros... Best handset of the planet	5
Fast ....fast..... superb	5
Great	4
Worth buying!!!	5
Amazing	5
The packing was very bad there was no protection layer around the box to prevent damage the box was just wrapped with a cover and so my onplus box was damaged on all sides while taking deliveryOneplus 6t is a premium range smartphone u couldn't defenetly get a better phone at this price.I was upgrading from my 2 yr old oneplus 3 and this one is defenetly better in terms of display. 6t has crispier display though i am not a fan of the notch . Camera is very good for the price with good detailing.Battery backup is fair as it would defenetly last a days of use.They shouldn't have removed the headphone jack.Sound quality is awesome.The drawbacks are they could have included ip certitication and included the headphone jackWith oneplus rolling out software updates regularly the phone would run smoothly for years	5
True value for money	5
Battery performance is awesome.Dash charger is really fast...with 4 amp. Camera is awesome with great clarity and sound quality is good. Phn looks sleak and cool . Fingerprint is up to the mark with no lags. Display is awesome with notch.worth the money	4
Awesome product, camera quality was good and battery and performance was good.. worthable for money.. android kha baap this mobile..I like very much one plus mobile.	5
Good amoled screen, improved camera is the best feature i liked	5
Words cannot discribe how good this phone is. One of the best out there. Recommended.	5
Awesome phone.	4
Where when and how can we get the type c headphones for the pre booking offer that was mentioned ?	5
There is no headphones	5
Just go for it	5
This phone such a amazing phone	5
Awsm phone Great  look	5
Finally it's here!! I order it on Nov 1st 12.01AM and got it on Nov 2nd. I have been constantly waiting for this mobile. I don't like fingerprint sensor on back and the notch display and this is the main reason I didn't buy OnePlus 6... This mobile has met my expectations. Camera quality is soo good, battery is performing well along with Oxygen OS. Simply the best Android mobile in current generation.	5
Beast of a phone with good battery, in-display finger print, beautiful design but lacks on a few of the latest features like IP68 dust and water proof and no wireless charging.But yeah there's a price for everything.Overall very happy with the purchase.	4
Never Settle	5
Amazing phone. Very fast	5
Really a flagship killer with this price. This is the shoot of evening time as you can see that the quality of picture is awesome. Build quality is good. Camera is superb and battery life is also works for whole day in heavy usage. Superb performance, gaming mode is superb option for gamers.	5
Great product.. but need some camera improvements.	5
battery drain issue	1
Superb	5
Woow , what a beast ! One plus 6t a worth buying this phone ! I would recommend everyone don't just think about it just buy it you will feel the speed	5
Camera Quality is kind of similar with other phone of less price	5
Go for it.. best phone at best price	5
One plus always rocks being a continuous fan of one plus from OnePlus 5T to one plus 6TIt's awesum mobile as usual ..but this time on screen finger scanner lacks quickness not as much fast as it used to be	4
Awesome camera and you can feel the pace of 8gb ram. Since phone has such high ram, battery is not something you can call extraordinary. But it is not bad too.	5
All features are perfectly Best. Mainly the camera is awesome and battery back up is exrta long as expected.	5
It's just been a day using this and love it, gotta use to explain in depth	5
Let's first talk about the picture quality of OnePlus 6t ...The night mode of OnePlus 6t is a really awesome featureThe picture does not blur or crack when we zoom to take a picture I like the mostSound quality of OnePlus 6t is also really good and about battery lifeIt's just awesome actually I have charged it only one time from 2days.. for frequent user it can long for two and half day easily.. the battery of OnePlus 6t get fully charged only in 1hr 15-20 minute by the provided amazing dash charger	5
I Didn't get full kit.back covers gorilla Glass	5
Best phone i ever had	5
I like each and every feature of this device especially the battery life is very good and this sound is higher than my old oneplus 3.Also I am feeling very lucky after getting this product I always trusted oneplus from the beginning and I am the proud owner of all the oneplus devices and specially I recommended this product to my father uncle and all my brothers and now they all having oneplus devices.	5
It's amazing ... OP 6t is just revolutionizing in mobile world. His camera quality quite compare to DSLR .... Must buy it.	5
Everything's good	5
Best ever	5
Really a flagship killer!	5
Airtel Sim not working on new oneplus6t, Pathetic.However other carriers are working	1
Best  phone eva	5
Writing the review after two days of use. This phone really shows the smartest way to unlock. Face unlock and finger scanner is awesome. Phone performance is also very good. Camera is great. Battery backup can be something which can be improved. But dash charging is again a great thing to have. Thanks One plus and Amazon.	5
One plus 6 is much better than 6t. While collecting data from one plus 6 to one plus 6t half of my data is lost. Previous picture and video are scrammbled. Without date and timing videos and pics are scrambled and new what's app videos and pictures are not showing in gallery.My whole music is lost while delivering from OnePlus to OnePlus 6t.I WILL PREFER NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE.	3
Best phone so far....must buy	5
Received the product on time.In love with the product.	5
Battery life is not goodIt goes down too earlyIt makes trouble for me	3
Awesome	5
I have purchased 6t and delivered today...after few hours of use it starts to hang and error occurred... some one can tell is this is ' unlocked the speed'	1
If you came here to see the reviews, don't worry just do it!	5
The dedication and good team work of whole one plus team members is remarkable in upbringing 6T. Hats off.....	5
Superb	5
Firstly I would like to thank amazon for timely delivery. One plus 6t is really awasome smartphone. Value for money.	5
Awesome phone.... I love it	5
most powerful phone, price, quality everything is best in IndiaI got hdfc 1500+1000 amazone payback+4000 for exchange +5000 cashback on jio  : now do the math	5
	5
Superb picture quality with tremendous battery life	5
Finally I got oneplus 6T. Superb mobile don't wait just order it and enjoy (If you looking to midrange mobile).	5
Just one word Flawsome !!!	5
1. 36,000/- is too much for this phone.2. Battery is lasting for 7 hrs if we use it continuously, without playing any games.3. On-screen fingerprint is worst, not working properly. Terms and conditions: we need to accept every T&C, otherwise we can return the phone, this one sucks.4. Fabulous look5. Good speed but not so much difference between 12k+ mobiles and this.6. Camera quality is very good but not extraordinary.7. Sound quality is good.	4
Very best smart Phone	5
Best mobile under 40kcamera, display, water drop notch, on screen finger print are awesome	4
Product is good but the mobile very early get the heat and it's really very hot at the time	2
Technology	5
Always good.... Battery is Superb... But sound Quality is Little bit Louder ... Remaining is Super... 	5
Perfect smartphone	5
Still worth for money	5
Awesome phone	5
Nice oneplus	5
More excellent from my view If u want to buy any phone under 40k Then please buy this phone	5
Just One Word - Awesome	5
No doubt this device is blazing fast. Great work from oneplus team. Battery life is just amazing.In display fingerprint, whenever you'll use you will realize that it's the fastest. Camera section improved and it really works well. Worth it.Display as you know super amoled, very smooth & delicate touch. Super bright.The best you get is lag free device and i m loving this.Must buy and if u already own op6 than wait for op7.	5
Awesome phne.love it	5
Best phone ever!!!	5
Got a great deal in Amazon and phone was delivered in just two days. Latest Android version with fast speed, better picture quality, sound is also good. Overall this is great deal in this segment compared to other brands.	5
First thing : I think amazon could have done better in delivering the product faster, i ordered it on November 1st and it arrived at the evening of November 5th,Second : The phone overall is decent, but i feel like the battery is draining alot, after 1 and 1/2 hour of gaming, the battery dropped from 99% to 59%Third : they can totally do better with their camera, its not what i expected from one plusForuth : Are the right side stereo speaker for show case or what? it doesnt work at all.the left side is amazingly loud thou, but what kind of socery is this?	5
Good	5
Best budget premium phone	5
Build Quality : 10/10Camera: 8/10 (Though, I believe this will change with software updates in the future)Sound/9/10Performance: 10/10Should You buy this over Poco f1?Ans: Yes, If you want better service guarantee and a well-built phone + Under Display FP Scanner.CAMERA:The camera is pretty decent for the price. The hardware setup which they are using is top tier but the only place where the camera falls short is the poor algorithm for Night Mode. Rest assured, XDA devs will probably push a Gcam later this month which will most probably pull the camera department upto a Solid 9 if not 10. Will update once that happens !BATTERY: This phone has the best battery backup I've seen in the industry. I am getting around 7.5/8 hours of SOT and the phone only takes about 45-50 minutes to fully charge. This was mindblowing for me.	5
Good look	4
Never buy this phone worst experience ever hopless phone	1
Everything is just super....you can only think what is not in this phone.... it's a rocking gadget	5
Excellent mobile worth your money	5
Add/ enable proper always on display.. without LED notification light we can't see notification.. really not satisfied disabled always on display/Ambiant display...	1
Well if you are moving from another brand to 6T than u will surely give almost 5 stars but I am using 3T since its launched and 5t from last 6 months so it's not giving me lots of supises which I was expected.Cons:- length is too much, not possible to operate with one hand or typing and some other task will be more though than you ever imagined.- no headphone jack and that dongle is not that much of robust like many times its got unplugged in pocket. Need to buy type C bullets now- front camera is overall average and as phone is not handy pictures will be blurred many times- NO Notification Light (sad react only)- I am tired now while writing this post- Its not that much of bright as compared to 3T in dark room- In display finger print is not working sometimes especially when your hands are dirty like dust and wet and slow to compare 3t n 5t or even many times display blinks and notification panel comes down software bugs I can say..- Round corners are creating a weirdo view in many applications and it's feel faulty.- That dewdrop notch is really really annoying while using some applications and your eyes will move there multiple times- notification icons are very small and sometimes hide when there are many including network speed- Phone is very heavy, well I am 6 ft tall and beast too yet it's annoying so think about it when you are girl where hands are soft and small :p- There are lots of software bugs which I can say they will fix in sometimes #hopeWhy I choose to upgrade because 3T is now old for me and I needed new UI and Latest chip and OnePlus performance was always good and based on personal experience I can't think about another flagship, well Note 9 was in cart earlier but almost 20k more after discount seems bad deal so 6T becomes final choice..- After some rounds of PubG you will tired as phone is big and heavyProns:- 7 hours continues play in Pubg with HDR and High frame rates, awesome experience like never before even in 5T. I am already in ace tire and now trying to reach in top 500 players and this device will surely helps me.- Pictures Quality is amazing when you click photos through rear camera now I will have surely a great pictures of Diwali 2018- Night mode is unbelievable when I clicked picture of my bed with lights off OMG.- Sound is 20% more loud than 3t and 5t its feels- It was 20% charged after 11 hours of using including two classic solo games in Pubg top 3 both the time which was I consider as surprise.- User experience is good and oygen os trying to show every information in a good manners.I have written above details based on 2 days of usage and I will again update this after this week of usage. Personal Suggestion, please invest more money in mid night black than mirror black you will thank me later as I ordered two 6T both the variants.	3
One of the best product i have seen and now using.	5
Pros: Hardware supports good speed and camera.Cons: Screen unlock doesn't work most of the time. Fingerprint is not upto mark and takes a few tries. Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one. This was the first time I had problem with a product from Amazon and they showed their true colors. Sameer goes for OnePlus.	1
Good product battery life is very nice i got 10-11 hours of screen on time on wifi and normal usage notch is not an issue with this phome as you can hide it in the settings. comes android pie and nov security patch out of the box. Overall a great purchase in 35500.( Including bullets)	5
Product is awesome but piece delivered to me is muted permanently. calls and notifications are without ring. Unable to restore ringing.	3
First thing first there is nothing wrong with one plus 6t.The screen is amoled which has good viewing angles.Colours are vibrant and screen brightness is also good.Camera is great but could have been better. Sound quality is good but lack of dual speakers still hurts.Battery backup is improved courtesy the 3700 mAh battery. Snapdragon 845 with oxygen os is an experience of its kind.Though I have used one plus since their flagship killer one plus one, a customer centric and community driven company is losing its own tagline of Never Settle by trying to settle down with no headphone jack,a camera hardware which remains same since one plus 5,no IP certification,no wireless charging.Above all the all the inflating costs of OnePlus phones when a smartphone with the same processor is being sold at half the price. I hope to see better innovative and original ideas from the OnePlus team in future as still I believe they can do it!	5
Amazing phone, definitely worth a buy!! Also bought this skin from  capesindia.com for the phone!!	4
Migrated from Oneplus 2 to Oneplus 6T and I am happy with the upgrade. After purchasing my first Oneplus 2 3 years before, I became a fan of Oneplus as I never had any issues. Oneplus 6T is having smooth navigation, hell lot of features dont know whether everyone uses all the features or not. Pics taken from the camera are awesome. Battery life is good, super fast charging. Phone size is also good while holding the phone with one hand. Only drawback that I have seen is removal of 3.5mm audio jack, so I have ordered one from oneplus site for 1.5K. Overall its an awesome phone. Thanks for Amazon for a quick delivery.	5
I purchased one plus 6t on nov 1st and gor it delivered on nov 3rd. Everything is fine but touch is not functioning properly at the corners of diaplay. Didn't expect such issue with onw plus	1
Awesome product	5
Only battery is as expected	4
Picture quality is good but the problem is quality of pic gets low in snapchat and other appsOtherwise there no such problem in mobileBattery backup is good as compared to other OnePlus devices	5
In Love with this device, the picture quality is so richThe real beast is here, I saw people comparing cheap Poco with this Premium device.Pros :Fastest in display finger print sensorNavigation GesturesBigger batteryNo cons as of nowWell if you are switching from a older device rather than one plus 6, this will is a best upgrade	5
Incredible phone..marvellous design, super speed, amazing features, fingerprint recognition super fast.	5
8+128.. Awesome performance, amazing on screen fingerprint and face unlock, camera top notch, amazing low light pictures (nightscape)	5
Amazing phone with all the best features	5
Keeping aside the price one plus has done wonderful job in assembling top notch hardware and polished UI but need to do more in camera department, overall app management is tidy and hardly visible memory leak bit at this price point how one plus " settle Down " on 2K display ,should have gone with 4K display ,I found it quite unrealistic approach,one plus 6 should avoid upgrade  .	5
Fantastic the only word is this phone.	5
Let's start with the notch as this is my first time with a notch device...I'm not a fan of notches but the notch that comes with this device doesn't come across (to me at least) as irritating... The teardrop shape blends in quite well with the rest of the body of the device...The device is as smooth & fluid as you would expect from OnePlus and the face recognition works incredibly fast... The good part that I discovered about the face unlock feature is that I registered my face without my glasses but it still recognizes me and unlocks the phone every time... So no worries with it leaving you hanging after a tough day when you can't be bothered to look carefully at your device for the face unlock to work...That brings me to the in-display fingerprint scanner... In most situations the face unlock is too quick and so I don't even need to use it but the scanner on itself works just ok... It's nowhere near as fast as the modern day fingerprint scanners on the backs of devices and the unlock speed of this phone with fingerprint is around the same as my OnePlus 2 from 2015... The only advantage is that the huge display you get and it's quite something to see up close (for me)...Battery life is incredible as well... I charge it for about 45mins to an hour everyday and it lasts me the whole day... Although I would say that I'm not a very hardcore phone user like I used to be but the phone lives up to it's expectation as you would want... Look up reviews on YT if you're really interested in getting this device...Picture quality is great in the phone, far greater than I could imagine... Takes clear shots and the slow motion also looks amazing... It just gets a little heated up after you shoot in slowmo or take a video in 4k-60FPS...Sound quality is as usual from the outside speakers and there's no headphone jack... It's annoying of course and so I've got a separate pair of earphones for specifically this phone and have connected the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter to it... I don't take it off and so that we way I'm less likely to loose it... So that takes care of the little issue...And yeah, the device is waterproof actually... Even though there isn't any official certification, it's waterproof to a decent extent...The only thing I wish to be changed about this device for now is the placement of the volume button... Unlike my previous OnePlus 2, they put the alert slider above the power button and the volume button on the left for the OnePlus 6T...This gets extremely weird from what was just working fine (volume button above the power button and alert slider in the left) in my opinion but that's just my personal bias...Overall the phone is definitely a fantastic package for the price...	5
Love this phone..There was an update after the 3rd day it went up for sale.The battery charges superfast and lasts really long.I don't need to carry a power bank anymore everyday.	5
Good sound quality, good battery life	5
One plus you genius.	5
Product is like ok ok that's all . Poor quality screen guard .boobles inside the guard. bad battery back up	3
Excellent phone with good picture and sound quality. Bigger battery. But 37999 for base model. So can't say it is budget phone for now.	5
Amazing superNice one products andExcellent workingThanks Amazon andCompany	5
Excellent battery life and charging, great camera and surprisingly good display and speakers!	5
So far so good.. but not big difference when compare OnePlus 6	5
Awesome Mobile phone :-)	5
Super	5
Good product	5
Good	4
Everything about this phone is awesome. No glitches found till now. Picture quality is fantastic, have taken some night shots and the results are awesome. Sound quality is better. I am using it since 4 days now and the battery lasts whole day with normal use on one single charge.All in all its just awesome.	5
The proct is good, display is awesome, but the sound quality could be better,	5
very good phone	5
There's nothing to dislike about this phone.	5
As always one plus at its best. Except the ever increasing price, all is good. It's now in LG g7 price territory.	5
Very good phone....	5
Its really an amazing phone.. a worth buy.. dont think its overprized.. it is worth it.. trust me i was a moto user but moto has now gone down and one plus is amazing.. without any second thought go for it.. amazing picture quality, sound too good, n battery the main requirement is superb!! Additionally, amazon is really so great to give you the best possible they can... This is the only e commerce site performing so well because its delivering so well.. a must buy..	5
Earphone jack is missing in the box	4
Best	5
Design......Was awesome	5
OnePlus you make great phones! I have bought and used every phone since OnePlus X !But it's kinda stupid to remove the headphone jack !And what did we get in return a slow fingerprint reader ?No IP rated Water resistance ? No wireless charging?Everyone's loves new features, but not at the cost of essential ones !	1
Very wrost product from one plus..my first experience with Amazon is very bad.ring volume is mute can't rise volume and one speaker is not working...	1
I loved the product so much.	5
The phone is totally value for money, the only thing which was a bit annoying about the OnePlus 6T Mirror Black variant was it was a bit slippery and a fingerprint/smudge magnet. Got a solution to this from Capes India, a black camo skin which makes my 6T look elegant and gives a good grip over it.	5
I like it	4
HIGHS-1.  Refined design.2.  Competitive price.3.  Great performance.4.  Improved camera.LOWS-1.  Fingerprint sensor isnt always reliable.2.  No headphone jack.	5
I have used two days and phone is good with speed and multi tasking but camera is worst, it did not meet even a normal 10000 rupees phone camera feature. I am planning to sell it out in OLX. Oneplus should stop increasing the phone size, since phone is slippery in the hand with 6.41 inches, always 6 or less than 6 inches phones are good to carry and handy.	1
Battery life is good	5
Simply the best that you can get for this price tag.	5
Camera is awesom...Speed and touch is so superb loved it	5
The only the thing that i doen't like is the otg c to 3.5mm connector cable wire is very sensitive it should be given as same as the charger otg wire	5
Best Smartphone for ever....High speed unlock using face recognize...Top speed..Amazing display...Best camera but still some improvement require...Best budget smartphone comparatively other premium phone..And at the end very good timely service by AMAZON AND SELLER	4
I didn't get this in the box - Type-C to 3.5mm Audio Jack Adapter	3
Oneplus camera is good and display is super and all are awesome in this phone and picture quality is good	5
This phone needs no comments just a 5phone	5
It is just like osam bt not so many changes measuring one plus 6 ...still great	5
best mobile n faster than all other.in design not like too good as note 9	5
Simply the fastest phone ever.Great camera and decent speakers. Don't really miss the headphone jack as everything I have is Bluetooth.In display fingerprint scanner makes you feel a part of a SciFi movie every time you unlock the phone	5
Bought it for 29165/- (Redmi note 5 exchange + 2000 instant discount on ICICI card + 1000 cash back at Amazon pay)  on the day of its launch.It's been 4 days with this phone and the experience is great.Pros:1) The on-screen fingerprint is fast enough2) Excellent display3) Great battery life (Getting 1.5-2 days)4) Superb build quality5) Android Pie out of the box6) 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 6 screen7) 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM on base 6T version.8) Comes with DASH charger which will charge your mobile from 0-100% in 1.5 hrs.9) No sign of heating during heavy usage10) Speaker sound quality is good and loud enough.11) Both Front and the Rear camera takes very good picturesCons:1) No 3.5mm jack ( An extra connecter will be provided in the box to connect 3.5mm jack headphone).2) No wireless charging.3) It has a glass back which means a fingerprint magnet. We should use back case( you will get a good quality back case in the box).4) It has 6.4-inch screen. Not for people with small hands.5) No notification lightThis phone is an excellent value for money. Just go for it, you will never regret.	5
I love it	5
Everything is good but the camera's picture quality is worst....it's disappointing factor for me even my iPhone 6 clicks good photos some times to compare OP6T. Sometimes auto focus is not working as well as picture quality is not good if you clicked 4-5 pics, 2-3 pics are out of focus and in night photography there are too much noise.And second problem is some times in display fingerprint not works well....taking too much time to recognize.-Battery backup is good (It's enough for whole 1 day if you charged once in the morning....Full charging gets approx 1.5 hr time)-Sound quality is average. Noisy speaker feels like a cheap. Some times I missed 3.5 jack.-Premium looks and display quality are awesome.-Speed and performance are fantastic.-And last It's Feels heavy.-Otherwise all things good.I got 3k discount on this phone when ordered on 1st nov (2k in ICICI bank debit card + 1k cashback on amazon pay) & also got 2K discount because of RS. 1500 earphone + 500 cashback early booking offer. So, overall I paid 33k for 6gb ram +128gb storage on 6T.	4
Best phone with good experience.	5
Switched from 3t to 6t 256 gb. This phone is probably the best in the market. Battery is phenomenal. Headphone jack? All those people saying that no headphone jack are probably bunch of idiots. And the reason why I am saying that is there is a headphone jack, that charger jack because I myself was skeptical about it but you don't need to charge and listen to music since charging is so fast you'll probably just need to wait for 10-15 minutes for a long hour usage. Best phone hands down. AND THE INCREASE IN BATTERY LIFE CAN BE SEEN EASILY. I PLAYED PUBG 5 MATCHES, THEN WATCHED A MOVIE ON THE PHONE AND EVEN THEN THERE WAS A GOOD AMOUNT OF BATTERY PERCENTAGE LEFT. AND the finger print. Haha, This is the best part. Indisplay fingerprint is very fast. And the implementation of a fingerprint inside a display is phenomenal with the speed OnePlus has given since it doesn't really take time to open. The GESTURES are exactly what I needed. Use OnePlus gestures instead of Google and it is totally worth it. Speakers are pretty loud even though there is one faux speaker for the aesthetics.Overall? This phone is miles ahead of OnePlus 6 with Better notch(the best implementation of notch and completely distinguished itself from the rest) Bigger batteryFinger print displayALMOST NO BEZELS.BEZELS BELOW THE SCREEN HAS ALSO BEEN REDUCED FROM ONEPLUS 6.	5
I ordered my phone on 1 St November through prime delivery but unfortunately delivery executive delivered me late I was expecting to get it before Diwali somehow after continuous chasing finally I received exactly on Choti Diwali  I wanted to give all 5 star to this phone but just because of late delivery specialy to prime members I am defecting 1 star otherwise phone is very much premium and better UI , screen size ,Colors , much better than IPhone in this price range good 8gb RAM It's value for money	5
Efficient and economical smartphone of 2018. Battery life crossing beyond 36 hrs with continuous usage of 4G data and camera. Phone works smooth and handy. Love those gestures UI	5
It's to much slow,and hanging problem	1
Every thing is good	4
It's really one of the beast and killer...in recent releases....really awesome mobile...user interface was mind blowing... stunning looks...and mighty camera... wondering OnePlus have launched an alien piece into the world....	5
The cameras could have improved.	5
This is my third iteration of the oneplus.. Having used the 1 and 3 before..Bigger screen and picture quality is a big plusNightscape/night mode seems little more than a gimmickOverall battery life is very good.. 3700mah battery does take some time to tocharge.if u are a impatient... But overall works wellStill waiting for the bullet headphones.. Awaiting information on amazons complicated process to finish	5
Phone is simply great. Good camera and good for night photography,bettery life is excellent, and the performance is just wow. Display is awesome, UD fingerprint is working fine.	5
Buy this without a doubt and you wont be disappointed. At par with any luxury phones out there, infact better	5
My phone hanged for approx half 'n hour. On third day of purchase  when I open YouTube, screen touch just stop working don't know what to do.	4
Quality and premium feel u get.... Its value for money when you compare it with other brands	5
Amazing experience with this bomb means this stunning smartphone	5
Superb	5
Compactible size. Easy to carry. Very good 1+.Speed is brillient. No heating issue on playing heavy games such as PUBG, CSR2 etc.Overall rating is 4.Camera is good but not better than SAMSUNG GALAXY S9+.Proceser is very fast.Keep it up 1+.Thank you	4
No words	5
True Flagship Legend	5
Camera I am still exploring how to improve pics as I still find note 8 taking better pics, but rest of features are just too good. Screen sensor is lightening fast, phone is very responsive.  Battery backup is decent (far better than my note 8). Other missing area is notification alert.	4
Awesome beast battery life,Smooth & fast (OS)JUST LOVE IT	5
Phone is built well...glossy black looks stunning.It's awesome to hold it in hand and has a solid feel. Better to get good case so that it doesn't get damaged due to all glass body. I recommend it.	5
Nice and any fast mobile	5
I bought 2 phones on October 31. And after the delivery  of it , i could only devote few minutes to see the features as i have my exam going on. So i gave it to my friends and after the usage of 4 days they told me that its awesome. They played various games they clicked many phoTos and the result was awesome.Really appreciate this one.	5
Picture quality is awesome .sound is good battery life is good last about a day and more	5
Best currently android mobile phone in market.With Excellent camera quality.	5
One of the best version from oneplus thank you	5
Oneplus 6t is a very good phone with good quality of pictures through camera and battery quality is very good and the sound quality is very well.	5
Picture quality is good but pixel has more better camera but still it's very nice portrait mode is good slow mo videos are awesomeSound quality is good but doesn't have head jack but wireless  Bluetooth is supported wellClear audio recordingFast charging enable very short duration of charging and long lasting medium use lasts for a day mild use may last for couple of daysOverall it's very nice product compared to pixel n Samsung note 9 n AppleThough it doesn't have water n dust resistance n wireless charging it's still best mobile phone that OnePlus has producedSuper fast processor smooth running n as of now mobile doesn't get heated even after heavy use but still have to wait n watchOverall nice mobile best that OnePlus has producedDon't worry of cost it's absolutely amazingWorth for the money	5
Just switched from iPhone to OnePlus 6t and I must say that this product is way more advance in terms of processing speed, user experience, camera, sound and many more is such great price as compared to Apple products. A must go if you are planning for a premium mobile with value for money.	5
awesome features fastest speed	5
Battery life is very disappointing even it is increased  by 400mah.Other features are good. Built quality is good.Product delivery is great.Night mode camera quality is average.Last but the least heating issue is also that cannot be ignored. We are facing little bit to moderate heating back panel on even normal usage.	3
The phone speaks for itself. Definitely recommended.	5
Aweome	5
Battery life is very less, other features are Good.	4
Battery life is amazing.. Overall one of the best phones available in the market..	5
Display,Camera, Battery life,Fast charging is awesome,Sound quality its not as expected.	4
Im happy with the purchase	5
I like the product, it's really friendly with my needs but previously I was using OnePlus One n some of display features of that mobile I'm missing here. All around it's my good choice.	5
No prlbm	5
Amazing is the world. The speed we need.	5
oneplus is known for performance and 6t is no exception. this thing flies anything i throw at it. it has one of the best cameras in this price range. audio is good, not loud like front stereo speakers but does it's work. i never liked down facing speakers and being on the left side it often gets suppressed by my palm. so far this is the only thing i hate about this phone. the 2nd best thing of this phone is the battery life. i haven't tested it fully but the battery is crazy good. if you've a budget of 40k then this is one of the best, if not the best.	5
Bad camera quality	1
Excellent product. A must have mobile.	5
MOBILE WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY TREMENDOUS CHARGING, FLEXIBILITY AND IN CLASS STYLE.....GO FOR IT BLINDLY DON'T HESITATE	5
The phone was handled by someone before it reached me. There were dust particles under the screen guard and mostly was not assembled in a clean area which is really disappointing. Apart from this, the phone is really good especially if you're upgrading from something like an OP3T and below. 10/10 would recommend, don't listen to the salty OnePlus haters just because it doesn't have a headphone jack. The UI is just too fluidic and snappy that you wouldn't feel like letting go of it even for a minute.PS: If it weren't for those dust particles I would've given this a 5 	4
Yes, I love this.	5
No words, pure speed, hats off	5
In love.	5
Superb 	5
Excellent product and handy also	5
Unlock the future...	5
Awesome	5
Really good features	5
Great phone... excellent camera pictures..	5
Stereo speakers would done great to device and wireless charging	4
Phone is too good....But comes in two colour variants only....In November might come in new colours but I couldn't wait till Nov.	5
Amazing phone loved it and proud to be a member of OnePlus community...	5
It's amazing but quite early to write a review!	4
Best oneplus product unbeatable features 	5
Very good camera quality and excellent night camera.just awesome.Battery performance excellentMostly security features .ohhhhhhI used Samsung note 8 but 6T to much faster.Face unlock and finger print scanner to much faster than any phone even iPhone.Water drop notch look very attractive.	5
The best Mobile I ever used. Better than iPhone	5
Overall a complete package. Camera is best in this price segment.My suggestion is that spent some extra bucks and buy the 8gb model if you do heavy gaming(Pubg,Pes 2018,Asphalt 9)and want super smooth multi tasking.Also the phone doesn't get heated even if you play games for long time.	5
Battery backup is insaneScreen quality is superb#neversettle	5
Okay so writing this review after 5 days use. I'll keep it sweet & simple. Camera & Battery life are unbeatable. Even people go crazy after seeing the in-built fingerprint sensor & the teardrop notch design gives this thing a look you can't forget . Build quality is more than superb. Those who say that poco f1 has the same processor don't really know what they're talking about & these two devices are way apart & poco doesn't stand anywhere in competition to 6T. Great product OnePlus & last but not least insanely fast delivery by amazon . Heads up!	5
A smart phone, which indeed is smart and looks stunning. It lets you customise everything.. you just have to figure it out how to do it.	5
Earphones are missing I didnt received my earphones	5
An excellent mobile phone. I m more than a Stasified customer.. Fast charging+Good Camera Quality+Good Touch+Fast processing	5
Best phone	5
No problem with the phone till now. Everything is beyond the expectation. suffered with the delivery. Had worst experience ever. Phone reached to my city on 4th November morning at 10.30 but they didnt deliver till 5th evening. At last i went to their delivery office(Ecom Express) and got my phone and the guy whose responsibilty was to deliver it was like "Acha hua bhaiya aap aa gye". I would give negative stars for your delivery partner i.e Ecom Express.	5
I am so happy use this mobile god's pictures good sound anyone is good and thank you amazone.love u one plus 6t	5
Too good	4
You just can't go wrong with this product	5
Amazing phone but Nightmode is not good. Dash Charger works like miracle	5
Camera is not good	2
The best till now!!Never owned a cell phone as good ever before 	5
Love the phone, specially the feel of on screen fingerprint scanner, its quit slow in comparison to  the 6, but I like it. Battery life is improved a lot.	5
this phone has oxygen os which works more or less same like iPhone x once its gesture setting turns onso there is no back key or home keythere is no bloatware like that of other androidsits a warning for apple herebeware u have serious threat	5
Only problem is you can't have Ring and Vibration at the same time for all the notifications	5
Was little sceptical whether or not to buy. But after using this beauty for 5 days, I'm extremely satisfied. There are still few patches to be pushed for seamless performance and I'm all excited.	5
So far so good . Loving this	5
Awesome... Worth every pennyBlazng fast... First time with oneplus... Hope the realtion continues	5
first time purchased one plus phone & seriously it is awesome value for money product with this price range.Simple one liner review: go for it if you have this budget..	5
They are exactly Working on their tag line "the speed you need". It's very fast. Very very fast. Talking about camera, that would have been better than op6. But nothing changed. Night scape is very good change. You can feel the light in nightscape mode. Audio is better than most of smartphones but not up to One plus mark. Battery life is best. You can rely on his battery for only one charge of half an hour with full day battery life even if you use it fully. Fingerprint scanner can't be better. New update help him open fast. If you have budget of 35k, buy it without second thought.	5
Excellent mobile	5
Amazon took just one night to deliver it. Super fast.After using it for 5 days , one thing is for sure it's super smooth. No lag even if I play pubg, open multiple apps. A new experience for me .Camera indeed one of the best. Clarity is too good.Dash charging is mind blowing but yes I feel the battery drains also a bit faster , but u can charge it in 10 mins and it will last for next couple of hours.	5
Bestest phone in Best Price!	5
Everything is good,But missing the notification light ,At least a small light while charging ,which tells us that charging is completely done	4
An excellent mobile and a must buy one... Fast charging... Exceptional performance... Just go for it...	5
Super fast mobile	5
Awesome mobile comparing any mobile 50k range one plus is excellent mobile super experience	5
Awesome phone	5
True Competitor to Google Pixel 3 Worth 75K, Excellent Device go ahead and buy it.	5
Best	5
Phone is really nice...but it's little heavy.over all it's good	5
Nice	2
I am a OnePlus One user who upgraded to this phone. Considering this fact, I am loving this phone. It's been 4 days since I got OnePlus 6T and I have charged only a couple of times for an hour or so each time; the battery is just brilliant. If you are someone who loves to click pictures and take selfies, you won't be disappointed with the various features of the camera in this phone.  I got 6 gigs of ram and 128 storage space in this phone, and it's damn quick and no lags or hangs so far! If you don't like the notch, not to worry, you will be able to disable it.One major disappointment was the 3.5mm jack's death. However, with their Type-C headphone adapter, you can manage to plug in your 3.5mm headphones.Lastly, if you are someone who's upgrading from OnePlus 3rd Gen., 5th Gen., or 6, consider waiting for the next phone from OnePlus.	5
First of all I would like to share the seller feedback, the delivery was awful by Amazon.But it was overruled by Oneplus, means oh my god, what a phone, awesome phone , nicely packed.Display 5 *Camera 5 *Battery 5 *Value 5 *Interface 5 *Overall 5 *Most important part is migration of data from old to new, thanks to oneplus switch app, oh it's too cool.My overall experience with first Oneplus is seems so good.Need some improvement , for e.g. music player and video player is missing.Let me use for few more months and then again revised or repost the review.	4
	5
Picture quality is good as it has lower resolution. Sound and battery is great.Simply love to use...	5
The phone is simply super and it works super fast.	4
Good	5
Battery life is poor very poor	4
Face unlock not working at dark night.At Day perfect working	4
I received the phone as expected date. The packging was secured.Quality of the phone is just waoooo.Love to have this cute flagship killer	5
The alert slider is not working. Did not expect a defected piece from amazon. very disappointing. for replacement a technicuan from amazon will come and report. before that im left wid no phone. its so disheartening.	1
Good phone, worth all the money.. if you are looking for a phone with good battery, decent camera and bigger screen with a brand tag, this is the best phone.	5
It's just good. Nothing exceptional. My previous phone was a Galaxy S6, I can still say with certainty there are many aspects in that phone far superior to this. It's an ok phone,nothing huge	3
Everything is good but battery pack up is not expected.	4
Good picture quality	5
loving it	5
Sound should have been better, with single speaker on bottom side it is not upto the mark. in my view there should be one more bigger speaker near front camera. if you have 5T or 6 there is absolutely no need to upgrade. This phone is no better than earlier ones.	5
No earphone and no case cover in this cover so it's absolutely fake products ..it has a big cheating to as...	1
Nothing to say awesome.loved it from core.but waiting for headset in Amazon	5
This is the best phone I've ever purchased. It's design and build is top class and so is the blazing performance. Battery life is super good. Camera is great and the screen is oled so colors are vibrant and beautiful specially those blacks. Fingerprint sensor isn't as fast a physical one but still is fast enough and a cool tech. The only little con is that there's no wireless charging and jack with the phone. It's software though is the best in my opinion as it only adds to the phone experience rather than detract from it. OS is slick, fast updates and it's very well optimised. Its a flagship phone for not a flagship price. OnePlus 6t is a plus plus for me in every way.	5
I shifted to one plus 6T recently and so far the experience is awesome ... I am impressed by the number of features and quality of battery.. battery is an issue with my iPhone 7 especially after the recent update to iOS 12 .. I was a bit concerned about the biometric performance of one plus after reading a few reviews but surprisingly that also performing very well ... I would say under 40k this is the best phone	5
All features are good & smart look	5
Excellent product from one plus. But the in display finger print is not that fast. Notch, display is awesome.	5
Phone is amazing. Picture quality is fab , battery life and charging is as always dash. But headphone jack is missing 	5
Superb in all aspects! Camera is outstanding. Good battery life,Great screen, Excellent performance. Affordable price compared to premium phones. Finger print  Sensor, face unlock are exciting features. Oxygen O/S is very fluid and smooth. Impressive rear &front Camera...What more can I ask for! Tottaly loving the device...I am happy Amazon!... Thanks a lot...!!!	5
Hello ppl.I purchased one plus 6t n got delivered d very next day.Excellent battery backup, faceunlock in low light n night timeFingerprint sensor v fast as in no other phone.A perfect phone	5
Look is fabulous...back camera is great...selfi is ok ok type.. battery life is great... ringtone sound is bit lower side.. performance is buttery smooth...touch response is great...dash charge is mind blowing....i feel rs37999 is not justified... little disappointed by oneplus this time	4
Superb picture quality. Longer battery life. Delighted with the one plus 6t.	5
Simply superb phone and that picture quality is awesome	5
Try it you will understand the performance.its a beast in this price range.there is no drawback i have seen in 1+6T.if u want a perfect phone in 40k range then its this phone.looks great.camera is very nice.all features are awesome.go for it	5
Price litter more for the Chinese companies.Good phone but go for lg think q7Dual speakerGood cameraNice battery life don't go with the battery numbers...One plus look so good premium and good bild quality... both aar good but	5
"picture quality", "sound quality" and "battery life".	5
If you're planning on this just go for it without having second thoughts!I bet you'll not regret!	5
Good phone....night mode need improvement	4
Picture quality is just so clear, also sound without earphones are good too but expected a ear phone with one+. Battery stays long charged also gets charged in minutes you can count on fingers.	5
No issues...	5
Good phone, good camera, good battery, fast for any games with awesome clarity for any android phone today. Love navigation gestures. awesome pictures with Night Mode on.Mirror black feels slippery in hands tough.	5
I,m custmer of oneplus  last 3 years ..I used one plus 5t +6+6t best phone forever	5
Battery drains faster I felt	5
More weightEverything is going well	4
A good phone	5
Satisfied with this mobile	5
Everything is super good. I have been a android from the beginning, this is an entirely new and smooth Android experience. Oxygen OS did it. Totally burden less UI. Camera is the best of all. But nightscape is disappointing compared to google pixel.	5
Another great phone from op. Excels in all categories.	5
This is an amazing phone. It surprises in every aspect from Camera to gaming to charging. It's an all-rounder. The best in class.	5
Excellent	5
Product is OK but battery is draining so fast.	5
thank you oneplus for making 6t for us	5
The mobile is just awesome and is very smooth to handle.only lags in fingerprint a little,but that is acceptable not too long. I love this mobile	5
nice	5
Awesome..	5
Wonderful phone. Totally worth it.	5
Camera is amazing	5
Got a good deal with exchange of my previous OnePlus 3.  6T is definitely faster, has a larger screen, better picture quality and larger battery life.  Battery charges to 100% in 40 min. I mostly use the phone for conf. calls, office emails, social media and watching movies. With constant use of all these features, I get a battery life of 20 hours on one charge a day.Night photography is not great even with the addition of new software used to recalibrate the pixels. Day pics are far better and provides very good clarity.Has been using it for 3 days now, so am yet to explore many features in detail. But overall a good phone.	4
If someone wanna buy One plus 6t for Camera reason then this phone is not a better choice, buy Asus zenfone 5z. Camera of OPt disappointed a lot.This phone's sound is not also better than Asus Zenfone 5z..Overall, Asus Zenfone 5z is a better deal not one plus 6t.	4
Best in the market. I'm not that much interested n changing mobile often n often but watching de trailer I switched n to one plus. Best n every thing but I'm worried abt battery backup. Lost 30per battery n one nyt even I kept de mobile without n touch. Just it has been 2days since n use hope it ll increase n future as it s still new one	5
Just the phone one needs. Camera is jus on point! 	5
This is my first OnePlus, everything is amazing.	5
Excellent	5
I really like this phone one of my favorite phone ...	5
I am not a android fan, although this is a good phone but as an iphone user i am not satisfied with the touch sensitivity. Its have more specification than an iphone. I miss my iphone	5
Everything is good.	5
Overall great phone but battery percentage not showing and daily data usage status not showing	5
It's value for money with bonus.Grab it without a single thought	5
beautiful display excellent performance	5
Makes apple cry	5
Awesome product	5
Good	3
Over all Performance is so good... Battery life could even more better	4
Best phone for 38k , it's  worth every penny .	5
Everything is good about this phone, but the SIM 1 slot is not working. This is a major drawback. When investing 41k, we expect everything to work in absolutely fine. This drawback overshadows the delightful experience of having one of the best smart phones in the market. Heard that this is a problem with most of the OnePlus 6 and 6T models. Please fix this ASAP.	4
Awesome phone , works blazingly fast ,low light photography loved it amazed me in every aspect ,face ulock is also fast ,overall smooth and the best phone i have ever used	5
Every thing is good enough	5
Best phone!!!	5
Overall a very good phone	5
Really? You need to read reviews now? don't you feel it!Great mobile with perfect camera and a massive battery life! Bigger display and picture quality is more than enough! If you have Budget go for it...there is no comparison at any price!	5
The best of the best at much better price.	5
All the three qualities are very good in phone with affordable price	5
Good	4
It's very nice phone looks premium the water drop notch design is awesome	5
If I try to find any issue, I will not find any. Its the best Android phone I have used upto till now.I have a iphone too,but since I received this One Plus 6t, iphone has just bcome a second phone for me.Great PerformanceGreat CameraGreat LooksGreat DisplaySimply Wow !!	5
It's awesome thanks to OnePlus 	5
Overall phone is the best but the only thing that I have found poor is it's fingerprint unlock, it's took a long time to open.Rather than that overall phone is very good no lag issues, no battery problem everything is perfectSo I must say guys if u looking for new phone go for it..	5
Good Android mobile	5
There's some sort of unstablness during slow motion , and heating during charging , showing your app isn't responding repeatedly, not showing call logs , most important.. finger print sensor doesn't work as expected ...... I hope it gets fixed with an update...	4
The fingerprint reader doesn't work sometimesI would prefer a rear mounted fingerprint scanner instead.Otherwise it is the best phone in this price range	4
Only one word "Amazing"	5
Beating Apple at every corner..	5
This phone has everything an average customer would like to have in his phone to have a feel of flagship without spending much. As it has already many pros so just going through one major con. The battery is not as expected from a 3700mah coupled with lasted oxygen os 9.0 running on pie. Hope to see it being improved in the future updates.	4
Amazing phone nothing to think worry just grab it	5
Superfast device amazingly awesomeA true flagship killer !!!Keep it up #oneplus	5
The flagship to try	5
Overall superb	5
Awesome! Just amazing how it smooth it works.	5
Worth the wait	5
It charges within minutes with a good battery life. The picture quality is enhanced by its incredible display!	4
Sorry not a review... ComplaintI didn't receive the type c earphones which I was assured when I bought the pre booking gift card.	4
Device heating up much faster while gaming and charging. Battery drains quicker while gaming.	3
Glamorous look, osssmmm camera, good battery back-up,	5
Excellent performance met my expectations.	5
The phone is amazing, however I was under in an impression that I will be receiving the type c earphones. I am still waiting for the same .please update me	5
Best phone	5
Nothing to deslike	5
Nice phone though no major upgrades provided compared to one plus 6	4
A very good choice to have all the latest tech for a valid price point!!!	5
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS GREAT. NO ISSUE WITH ANYTHING AMAZON DELIVERED THIS PHONE IS ONE AS PROMISED. CAMERA, DISPALY, NOTCH, MATERIAL USED, EVERYTHING IS AWESOME. JUST AS WE ARE BUYING SO MUCH COSTLY PHONE WE EXPECT 5G. ALTHOUGH ONEPLUS SAY NEVER SETTLE NOW I HAVE TO SETTLE WITHOUT 5G LOL.WELL STILL ITS A GREAT PHPONE AND BETTER THAN IPHONE.	4
Nice phone I'm loving it	5
One plus 6t is the best phone ever	5
All the phones that follow must take this phone as a benchmark in everything. Thanks one plus	5
It is a beast of a phone. It gives you the best experience you can get from an android phone. Games run smooth af. Camera is great and so is the battery life. Worth every penny!	5
Performance Was Excellent	5
Okay I'd like to talk about a few things that nobody else is saying. The battery life is excellent for a flagship phone, about 8 hours of SOT which is more than excellent, also the speaker, though single is loud enough for the noisiest of environments. And the people who think that the new fingerprint scanner is too slow, I received a software update as soon I activated the phone, and after I updated the software, fingerprint scanning was a lot snappier.Overall, great phone in the price range.	5
Awesome mobile	5
Awesome phone great speed super camera....I love it	5
Wow what a great phone everything is awsome	5
soo good but still did not get the prebook cashback and earphone code	4
Really super phone	5
Superb...	5
awsome phone camera was outstanding	5
One of the best phone with great performance... Worth buying it	5
Awesome Phone, I am a OnePlus user since 2016 previously I'd been using OnePlus 3T and that a very good device too...and now I've upgraded to OnePlus 6T and this is just amazing Phone. Killer performance., Decent camera., Sound quality is also good., If you want a premium phone in budget then go for it., This phone will not disappoint you.. if you already a OnePlus 6 user then don't upgrade.	5
Bigger battery	5
Beast.Simply powerful enough.	5
Excellent camera especially night scape mode	5
Nice phone	5

As the title says its a flagship with no exceptions or asterix needed. Great build quality, top class screen, sleek design, fantastic battery, decent camera and stunning performance with in screen fingerprint scanner innovation.	5
One of speaker is not working	5
Battery life is really very good. I was using one plus 2 from long time. So I know what the quality of one plus provide. Now I bought 6T through the exchange . (Thanks for offer "Amazon" and it's offers). One word for phone is "Excellent". If you can afford don't miss opportunity to buy it.About 3.5mm jack since I did prebooking I will get for free of cost 	4
Wow superb picture quality	5
From the water drop notch to the screen unlocking worth the money.	5
very nice phone one plus 6t .camera is awesome	5
I love OnePlus	5
This is my first One Plus phone and after buying and using it, I am glad that I made the right choice. A premium phone with A class features and superb camera quality. Battery life is also good as of now depending upon my full day data and Bluetooth connectivity experience. Thumbs Up to One Plus 6T.	5
Best phone ever	5
All the features of a flagship phone, fast and smooth operation, all coming at a  great price 	4
Superb excellent!!!	5
Quite a package with best in class processor, camera and touch sensor. Im happy to be part of thr oneplus community.	5

Fingerprint is little bit slow,take time to adjust frommy old oneplus6	4
Love it	5
Premium product but unable to avail the kotal free warranty offer related to the product . Customer care executives are of no help in this matter .	5
Superb	5
Amazing phone.. deserve 5star easily.. delivery was on par .. awesome...	5
Picture quality is gud ND phone gets heated fast	5
One Plus really made this phone very cool. Every phone has flaws even this one has few. Sound is good not best, Camera is good but not the best again. Really smooth and snappy. Not worth upgrade from 5, 5t, 6 to 6t.	4
It's just amazing sound quality is super and picture are just awesome just go for it.	5
Good looking phone build quality great	5
Super fast. Awesome display. Love it.	5
You won't regret in any way if you buy this premium smartphone. Obviuosly much faster than the iPhone and the in display fingerprint is just wow.	4
Previously I'm a an iPhone lover,but had many issues with battery and other valuable fetures. So, I shifted to one plus 6T which is amazing thing happened in my tech life. Picture quality,sound quality,screen size, battery optimization feature, touch pad all these are extrodinary effects in this phone. Buy it U will not regret of it.	5
Plz don't buy this product.. replacement product still send damage product phone getting hang while picture and video starting.plz don't buy	1
Expectations fully satisfied with One plus 6T, Finger print senser work little bit slow but it's really good, updated camera pictures quality and video quality.	5
Proud to be a fan of oneplus.upgraded from my oneplus 3 to this beautiful and powerful oneplus6t but missing led light for notifications n charging	5
I Really Love this Product..	5
Pros: Glamorous looks, great free case, free screen guard, camera like SLR, super fast, face detection is lightening fast.Cons:  On screen sensor not super quick if not properly setup. If you setup properly, it's good.	5
Best from 1+	5
Its real a + in cell phones. Great Features!	5
Camera is a lit	5
Nice Phone....But missed the LED for notifications.Good Camera, Good Processor, Amazing Display... Good Speed.	5
Everything is good about this phone.... delivery....price.... display... sound... camera...speed	5
OnePlus 6T built quality is superb pictures quality, sound quality & battery too good perfect package	5
The tagline is the perfect mark of the phoneI haven't experienced that much speed even in iPhone. I loved the dash charge feature, battery life , mirror black look gives the phone a sexier look .Only the thing I not getting satisfied with is the picture quality coz when you zoom it the pixels burst out so here I prefer the iPhone's picture quality . But all in this phone is BEAST and gonna change perception of people from iPhone to One plus .	5
Awesome	5
Loved it. If you're in doubt, then don't be. If it is in your budget then don't think twice, just go for it.	5
Phone is amazing..but its getting heated when you play games or use while charging	4
The phone is really awesome and has all the latest features. No issues whatsoever...Thanks Amazon for fastest delivery...	5
My last phone was iPhone 6s, and I assumed it would take me a while to get used to the new phone with different Operating system. But it is so amazing and user friendly. I said I love the phone as soon as I started using it. the picture quality is amazing & the voice quality is so much better than iPhone, the speaker is much much better than iPhone and the battery life is the best. In Love with dash Charger. Thank you one plus for making it so affordable and yet so awesome.	5
Amazing phone.. I have successfully unlock the speed	5
Stunning phone wish the sound could be less it's like a mini Bluetooth.	5
Very easy to transfer my oneplus 3 data	5
What a phone excellent , speed camera battery just amazing must buy	5
The phone is amazingMirror backUltimate phoneLoving my new phone	5
It's awesome	5
One of the best mobile in the market. The only issue is no 3.5mm jack if that's not an issue go for it blindly and use a connector provided by one plus or buy type c earphones from one plus.	5
Love this feature packed phone.	5
Excited to purchase with exchange which was smooth.  No complains on that front. On using the phone for the last 12 hours,  really fast and smooth with very fast processor and no lag even on multi tasking.  No heating issues as such so far.  Only thing that I felt could have been better was weight of the phone,  which is slightly on the higher side. Will update later	4
Nice phone. Loved it. Battery life is awesome. Picture clarity is mind-blowing. And the night scape mode is nice but can be improved. Overall A good product to buy . Worth it	4

It's been two days I am using this phone. It's great so far. Excellent picture quality, sound quality n battery backup.	5
You cannot compare it's speed with any other Android Phone, It's a beast. Rest all works as it should, No complaints till now. Please stop comparing it with cheaper phones, This phone belongs to some other league.	5
OnePlus 6T - A truly sensational smartphone	5
Phone is really great with fast and smooth in every use. During first use finger unlock sensor is quite undetectable sometimes as it detect tyour finger in the same you at exact same location you registered. If your finger is little tilted also it wond detect. Overall it is great. The face unlock is also extremely fast, it wont take any time for animations. The port converter type-C to 3.5mm jack is not working.	5
It is my first experience in OnePlus mobile but after using so many days  i m big fan of OnePlus mobile....OnePlus 6t is one of the best budget phone under 43k nd camera , ram management nd battery life are super For my experience it best mobile so guys buy it without any doubt u really enjoy 	5
Everything is awesome	5
Two years from now and people saying lg g7, zenfone 5z and xiaomi mi mix 3 will understand the value of oneplus software support and updates which makes the phone way superior to the others. Mark it !	5
Best phone	5
You'll get more only for more than double it's price.	5

One Plus 6T is the good device but the finger print censer is not good.when i add my finger print for screen lock that current time the censer works properly but if i use the same thing after some hours the censer don't recognized my finger prints. so that the main problem about finger print censer.	3
It is amazing device by one plus. Nothing is wrong about this one. I just loved it...the nightmode especially..If you are in doubt...just don't be...#neversettle	5

This is Perfect!	5
What a DASHHHHHHAmazing looks amazing performanceBus naam hi kaafi haiONEPLUS....GOOD SERVICE AMAZON	5
Migrated From Pixel 2 XL to Oneplus, except camera i find this phone at par or even better than Pixel.Most importantly the price i paid was far less than the cost price. (1500 instant discount, Amazon Pay 1000/- addition), also did a pre booking to get a Oneplus USB Type C ear phone free along with 500/- Amazon Pay add and the icing on the cake is getting 10X points on HDFC Regalia which equates to 4500/- worth points....Amazing Deal by Amazon and HDFC.	5
Awesome product ... Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (with in 12 hrs)	5
i'll give 10/10 to oneplus 6t face unlocking fingerprint sensor sound quality picture quality and night mode is awesome ..thanks to amazon for such a great offer and fabulous delivery	5
Gesture is good. Speaker not that good	5
Oneplus 6T is the best phone you can get with less than half the price of iPhones.All the features are really good. Oneplus has been consistent in upgrading their brand & added new features into their phones. I am skipping the PROs of the phone(which is a huge list, already described by many ppl)CONs:Fingerprint sensor - slower than previous models + you need the screen to be switched on before using the fingerprintHeadphone jack removed & extension chord is provided. This is a big let down!Tq	4
Best sound & picture quality	5
Finally found the worth of my money	5
Soon,this company will beat apple.	5
The night mode is the excellent things which one plus 6t has and all the features are perfectly good and sound is excellent	5
OnePlus never fails to amaze. It is a solid phone for the price. The included case is great as well and quite protective for my needs. I don't miss the headphone jack at all, using Bluetooth headphones is more convenient and unless you're an audiophile you can't notice the difference in sound quality. The battery is a beast and the performance is amazing.	5
This is one of the most anticipated phones of 2018. It's really amazing. Camera,video, performance is second to none.	5
Amazing phone upgraded from Samsung Galaxy s8 ... And I'm totally loving it ,better battery better picture quality ...	5
The phone is a awesome piece	5
From my one day use the phone is amazing... Expect the on screen finger print. Some times it's not work up to the mark.	4
Very pleased with the performance.- Works effectively in the low network signal.- Impressive picture quality.- Very fast face recognition algo.- Wifi receiver is also very good and able to catch weak ranges too.	5
Every thing is awsome	5

Crazy for oneplus 6t	5
Very good oneplus phone. I am replacing from oneplus3 and it is an excellent replacement. The speed and indisplay fingerprint scanner are the best. Bigger battery and fast charging is a bliss. The sound quality of speaker is awesome. Camera user interface needs some improvement. I didnt explore the camera enough to comment but I think studio lighting and night scape features require an update.Amazon delivery was excellent. I am waiting for the pre-order freebies. I look forward to an option to get wired bullet earphone or get 1499 off against wireless bullet. Overall i am happy with oneplus experience but i look forward to more on camera front which i am sure will be delivered via future software updates.	5
actually little worried because the package was tampered little bit	3
Fastest Phone,I Ever Used. Good Camera,Nice Feel. Totally Awesome Phone	5
Nice	5
I always wanted to have OnePlus phone and when they announced 6T, then I made up my mind that I will buy this phone.I got it without pre-booking offer so no type c bullet earphones. But hats-off to Amazon for the before the time delivery again.Now for phone -1. New in-screen fingerprint sensor - Very slow as compare to normal fingerprint sensor.2. Battery - 3700mAh makes difference and with proper use you can get approx 1 day of charge time.3.  Notch - Tear drop notch is good as compared to other notch sizes and you get more screen size.No major or unknown issue yet discovered, its a good phone in this range.My rating - 9/10	4
Awesome phone...Don't believe negative reviews abt the phone... Sound quality (even though audio jack is not there) is very good..picture quality excellent asusual superb.. Good battery backup... Fingerprint scanner speeds up after update...	5

Awesome device with a premium look. Fully satisfied with my new Oneplus 6t. Also the fingerprint works very well.	5
Amazing phone for the price. Really crisp display and offers good value for money. Loving it :)	5
I am fully satisfied with the product and also with delivery of Amazon services .Night mode pics are just awsm ..	5
First of all, I had a Samsung S8 and I wanted to buy a new phone. So, I started searching and read a lot of posts on what is the best phone available right now. I had a few options. LG Q7+, poco, mate 20(not yet released) etc. But after a lot of speculation and hype I went on with the OnePlus 6t.Pros:1) Good screen(not the best in the business though)2) Solid Build Quality3) Premium feel and a good looking phone4) Solid battery(1 and a half day of regular use)5) Decent camera.(cannot compare it to the pixels and the iPhones of the world)6) Good value for money.7) Android pie8) Dash charger.(best in the business)Cons:1) A little problematic with the Bluetooth connectivity. My old phone S8 had no problems when using a Bluetooth headset. But there is a small issue in this phone. I have to restart the phone again to get it working properly.2) Speaker quality.3) On screen fingerprint scanner.(Accuracy-7/10) and a little slow(hopefully software updates will fix it).	5
Roaming not onEar speaker volume not work	1
Worth Upgrade from 5t#neversettle	5
The best Android phone ever	5
Great phone, awesome camera and blazing fast speed...!!Must buy if you are below OP6.	5
The phone looks awesome in your hand ! Looks extremely attractive .. camera is amazing	5
Battery is terribly bad.On round edges I lose the display as it cuts the actual view.Sometimes AutoRotate does not work. I have to restart the mobile.	1
Pic quality :- Best ever in it's segmentSound quality :- greatBettery life:- full day funThe best thing is OS.	5
One of Iphone	4
Early days into using the phone, but have loved every bit of the experience till now. First and foremost it is surprisingly easy to use, I mean it adjust very easily into the grip even after it's relatively big size. The curved back makes it easy to use and manoeuvre . The camera is pretty good and does well in all of it's mode but yes still some distance away from the quality of Pixel cameras. The battery life is great and last for almost 24-30 hours per charge. The oxygen OS is almost stock like and gives a very uncluttered experience. The performance of the phone has been top notch - switching between apps is smooth, performance during games, watching youtube videos etc has been fluent and top notch. The in-display fingerprint works almost perfectly. It's fast but at times is unable to recognize. That is probably the only complaint with the device. Good Job One Plus. :)	5
Excellent Product	5
Speed at its best!	5
Battery will charge quickly and drain quickly. No significant changes other than fingerprint and waterdrop when compared to one plus 6	4
Everything is perfect in this phone..! I mean everything camera quality.. Fingerprint... Battery  speed everything is at bestI was already using one plus 5 and now upgraded to one plus 6T.. If you have bugdet of 40k then you should not go for any other option just close your eyes and trust on this productThank you one plus for giving this amazing product 	5
Awesome product	5
Good	5
Fast toy in my collection	5
Always been a fan of one plus.	5
Awsm phn with good features....	4
Great picture QualityGoogles Android is the best AndroidMuch-improved designBreathtaking camera both on the front and backBattery life is far better than other smartphone in this segmentPrice is very much under control when compared to the features of the phoneDisplay is just awesomePhone speed is lightning fastPhone is being fully charged in just 34 minutesThe best part of the phone is it's In display Finger Print sensor !!I have just started using the phone ,will continuously post the pros and cons of the phone as I use it more !!!	5
I like speed...	5
OP6t is great good looking premium phone.Undoubtedly phone is awesomeCould have been 5000rs cheaper then original cost.Little over prised phone.	4
Awesome phone with excellent speed and superb camera	5
Great phone at these segment	5
Awesome mob...I loved it	5
Worth buying..	5
Very smooth and very good performance	5
Battery life amazing..Picture quality.. especially the night shots . On the pointSound quality speaker is again not bad.I have upgraded from Mi to one plus ... To be honest I was an iPhone but . Damn this phone though. Speed ram management is perfect..	5
Best mobile in below 40k segment	5
Fingerprint is cool even though you feel that it's taking time to unlock. Vibration feel has set the standards of one plus on top. I don't like vibration of any phone but..now I feel warm when it vibrates.	5
It is a nice phone under this price range.Camera and battery is superb, although I am missing 3.5 mm jack, but it comes with type c to 3.5 mm jack connector so no complains.Sound quality is good.	5
This is the best from the best. Totally loving this phone. A real quality product. Comes with the latest software. Got an update the minute I booted it up for the first time. Blazing fast and smoothest experience.Loved the camera performance. Comes with night mode and studio lightning to be rolled out soon.	5
Able to make phone calls, read messages and install other apps easily. Able to play games like PubG and able to switch between apps without lag or heating. Hope thats how premium phone works. Good camera with night feature need to explored during festival times.  Other things as described.  Good OS looks new until new version comes in next six months. Let down for me was removing traditional 3.5 mm jack. Converter for headphone will be lost soon if I keep using it during travel. Waiting for free earphone from OnePlus since I pre-ordered.	5
Battery life is going to over lit bit faster.....	4
Best phone ever.. tag line is appt unlock the speed.. and you feel it's premium one	5
Best driver I ever used	5
Best driver I ever used	5
The camera alone is worth everything! Absolutely love it. It's just been a day but it's doing great!	5
Product is awesome. I loved it. But I have one issue I had pre-book the order and I was eligible for free hands-free USB C-type. I have not received any Gift Card on my mail yet kindly look into this matter.	5
BATTERY IS AWESOME BUT CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GREAT JUST OKAY. PHONE IS QUITE BIG EVERYTHING WORKS LIKE A CHARM	4
i like her style of body look	5
True flagship killer !! Loved it 	5
It's just perfect in all departments.From design, camera , speed, UI, everything it's mind blowing.Loved it	5
Superb phone great pre order offer. 3 cheers	5
The mobile is just awesome in terms of everything. And If u r upgrading from one plus 5t and lower version of mobiles then I would say worth upgrading as I was using One plus 5 previously and this gave me a wonderful satisfaction....Negative about OP6t is No headphone jack, etither u can use headphones or u can charge the mobile at the same time. And notification light is not there , you will not get to know until u on the screen .....so over all I can say the mobile is worth for money .....	5
One Plus 6T1 in Brand1 in Speed1 in PerformanceCaptivating low light image capture, Impressive in-display fingerprint, Hassle free exchange, Loved itBut I prefer AndroidOS over OxygenOS.	5
100% worth if you spend the money for it.Good in build quality and design.Cameras are too good.Display and battery also fine.	5
So far so good	4
Huge display screen, camera quality is too good. Charged it for first time and battery is still going. Its almost 2 days and, the battery is still up. overall, good.	5
Excellent product ! Full value for money better than iphone !	5
The phone arrived in a properly sealed packet. The delivery agent didn't wait up for product verification. The picture quality of the rear camera is excellent in the given price bracket. Sound quality has improved a lot since i was a one plus 3 user so I can bet on the same. Battery life easily lasts for 1 day with a heavy usage.	5
If you compare it from Iphone XS, this is a great option to buy.	5
First offall thanks to One Plus company to making such a nice phone... Very comfortable for using,,, camera quality is awesome... Sound quality is OK.... Battery life is great .. But It's little bit heavy... That's OK will adjust... Totally amazing phone... Thanks Amazon... For one day delivery..	5
Best for this price point. A true flagship killer	5
One	5
Best build quality,excellent camera performance with dual led flash,good stereo specker and nice back cover.Only one drawback, take time to unlock the device by using finger but  better to use face unlock feature. It's quicker than finger scan.I have checked benchmark (Antutu) score.It's 295780.I can say OnePlus 6T is far better than OnePlus 6	5

I have been using this phone for the last 3 days and still learning. Its got loads of features.	5
First of all thanks to Amazon for one day delivery .ProsGood displayGood camera qualityGood build qualityCons:Night cam needs to be improvedNo notification LedNo FM radio	5
Slow motion video quality is very pathetic. When you try to shoot a video in slow motion the video screen turns dark and starts fading on/off. Not at all expected from newly launched phone.	4
Awesome... Really worth buying	5
Issue with the Camera Slow Motion Mode is Not Working in Home Black Shade is Moving from left to right Sound Quality is not that good	5
Superb phone purchased 8gb ram and 256 GB variant.	5
Awesome phone with great battery life and best design...	5
Just a little less handy considering the huge screen but worth every penny spent. Amazing speed and quality	5
Super phone....ONEPLUS 6T	5

No compromises 	5
The phone got stuck while using one of camera features. Its not even getting restarted. The screen is freezed thus, not allowing to proceed further. Hope i get a replacement soon.	1
A must needed phone	5
Inside box no handset	5
Pros are many. They just need to add a few things like to speakers instead of one and Dock charging.	5
As always oneplus rocks!	5
Osm phone just go for it	5
Best design,best features and that too very fastJust go for it!!!	5
OnePlus always bring latest & new technology on its mobile.	5
Nice phone	5
Every thing was good but the scanner is a bit slow and sometimes it was not responding properly. And I have found some scratches on the pre-applied screen protector. But mobile is awesome !	3
Please don't buy..gets heated, doesn't startCustomer care has no interest pls don't buy 6t worst one plus product	1
Good phone..nice picture quality ,sound and battery ..but there is slight touchscreen problem especially in top corner..	4
Great phone at a great price. Definitely a must buy flagship killer!	5
Product is awesome . camera is jst speechlessly awesome but one thing is lacking behind that is Not having effects while cliking from camera like do have in other one plus phones. Rest all is nice to use , fingerprint is lil less smartly active in compare to Face recognition(its superb). No regrets after buying One plus 6t	4
OnePlus has always focused on speed, build quality and a brilliant camera. This new version of OnePlus keeps the promise. It does well in all the fields it aims to make a mark in	5
Fastest in the market.Face recognition combined with finger print scanner is the coolest way to unlock the phone.Its so smooth to use.Go for it.	5
Got the most amazing phone in the world while participating in Guinness World Record event at Mumbai. This is my first OP phone. I am feeling proud to be OP Community Member.	5
1 thing i miss is earphones problem	5
feels premium when u hold it .. camera is awesome though need to take this beast in low light and test it. volume is good. clear sound quality. battery life - have not tested yet but seems ok types . in display finger scan looks really awesome. face unlock is really really fast . didn't expect it to be so fast.overall really really satisfied.	5
Awesome Phone loved it it's future proof I have bought the high end variant loved it has enough storage just take this phone true value for money	5
I have been using iPhones since more than a decade and for the first time, I changed over to Android phone.  OnePlus 6T is a wonderful phone with latest technologies.	5
I've been a iphone user but this is the first time I'm using Android phone OnePlus 6t n trust me no words !! This phone is lit !! Really amazed n blown away by it !!	5
I was initially hesitant to shift to Android after using iPhone for more than 4 years. But I went ahead with my gut and purchased this device on the very first day. The device came next day morning and trust me.. This device will amaze you.The device is very fast and battery is long lasting. In most cases, apps loaded faster than the latest XR (my friend and I were testing) and the OnePlus Camera is better than iPhone XR.The fingerprint unlock works as it should. It takes a little time longer than the screen unlock.Overall, this is the perfect device if you don't want to spend a fortune on the latest iPhone and want to give this a try.	5
Premier look wonderful features . But lil overpriced	5
Awesome picture quality and sound quality, best battery life	5
Nice phone.. sound quality and picture quality and all very good but battery life is not good as I expected.. it's worth a phone to buy..	5
Sound can be better  but it is good.	4
Better life is good !! But it takes 1hr and 15 mins for complete charge	3
Well over all 1+ 6t is cool ...	5
> This flagship works better with its camera.  I have upload the picture to know the camera quality of the phone.>The 3750 mAh battery works good with better battery performance.> The appearance & activation of fingerprint sensor is nice.	4
This is undoubtedly one of the best smartphone with top notch performance at a rate as much as half the price of iPhone X. Camera mode comes with different variants which makes it look really cool. A Booster for gaming, which comes with different configurations to handle the notifications and calls. Its long lasting battery, fast charging, navigation bar customization, quick on-screen fingerprint scanner, and plenty of storage, makes it a sensational smartphone at a much lower price than iPhone X, mate 20 pro and pixel 3.	5
A big fan of oneplus. This is so far the best from oneplus. The stock android and with oxygen OS makes your phone experience as smooth as it can ever be. The camera is very decent. The nightscape mode is okay, i miss the pro mode that was better but its okay. For gaming purposes this phone is a monster. Pubg or asphalt there is no lag. You will forget what does the word hanging means. The face unlock is super accurate even works in night.Just buy it. Battery lasts all most 2 days.	5
Amazing phone ... Only should have had surround sound other than that it's incredible !	5
One word Flagship Killer	5
Worth of money . Battery life is good. But the picture should have been improved	5
Nice	5
Good purchased, value for money	5
Awesome user experience except indisplay finger print sensor	4
Amazing phone but they could have offered wireless  earphones at a discounted price for the customes who all made advance booking.	5
I like its full display and picture quality is good but temperd glass should be given to all customers	4
1.Takes too long to charge...took 80minutes to charge from 10%-96%.2.Battery life went down from 100%to 10% in less than 20hours without much usage.3.Fingerprint sensor not very receptive.	2
6T is yet another fine Discovery by OnePlus team.Though I would have appreciated if C type earphones were given along for the people who pre-booked it.	4
Amazing gadget, battery life is awesome... i charge in the morning and enjoy whole day without charging tension till night while whole day internet data is on. I already have Oneplus X and upgraded to Oneplus 6T was right decision for me.Camera quality is awesome, i have compared with Samsung S9+, Galaxy Note 9 and other phones too....but no one can beat it.	5
So I got my OnePlus 6T delivered last morning..and after charging for 30 mins when I switched it on..the screen seems to look like the image I uploaded..tried restarting the phone and also charging it..I hope I get a replacement or refund soon..very disappointed!!!	1
Awesome phone ..worth waitingSpeed ultimate	5
Really oneplus 6T is a best phone in this time in market or in this price range..Battery performance is best...Camera quality is also good specially night mode..Display is very smooth it's imagine feeling to use full HD water drop screen..	5
Awesome phone, very well performing!!!	5
Osm	5
Awesome	4
-2nd day delivery-Best smartphone for the price offered-Battery life is awesome... two days with normal usage without any heavy downloads-Charging speed is awesome... 0-90% in 1 hour-Blazing speed for games (PUBG)-Feel night camera option is not good-Overall happy with the product	5
OnePlus 6T ProsBigger display with water drop notch design look beautiful and AMOLED panel also very good.OnePlus 6T has upgraded 370mAh battery which is 400mAh bigger then OnePlus 6. It also comes with Dash charger one of the fastest smartphone chargers.The base variant comes with 6GB RAM 128GB of storage and price are same as OnePlus 6 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant.The main highlight it has the in-display fingerprint sensor and this is one of the fastest in-display fingerprint sensors.OnePlus known for their stock like Oxygen OS and this time the OnePlus 6T comes with Android 9 pie.New Camera mode like Nightscape and some other photography features are really good.OnePlus 6T ConsThe Oneplus company known to listen to their consumersvoice, but this time There is no 3.5mm audio jack.The main cons of all OnePlus devices are lacs on microSD card support, yes it does not have any microSD card slot.There is no IP rating for waterproof and dustproof.OnePlus 6T does not have dual speakers like it should because other brands are now offering dual speaker setup.This time OnePlus also use glass at the back but it does not support wireless charging. Now, these days every flagship smartphone has wireless charging support.Frankly speaking the OnePlus 6 still a good device there is no major improvement on OnePlus 6T. If you are a OnePlus fan and wants to buy a new smartphone then you can buy this. But if you already have the OnePlus 6 then dont waste your money because OnePlus 6 will get all the software feature via OTA updates...	5

Best phone in the market at this moment...	5
Only one line is enough- Asus and poco can't be substitute of OnePlus.	5
8gb Ram is the best thing in the phonei found finger print scanner have some glitch in it.camera works at its bestbattery as said fast charging, i kept phone for charge at 5% it took 1.5 hrs to full charge the phoneBattery works best, is a life saverface unlock doesnt work in nightphone functions smoothly, better than iphone as i am a iphone customer too.few functions like pocket mode and all i liked it.speakers are not that great	4
Hello,Now I've been using this beast since few days, this phone is a beast there are no complains against anything about this phone.Battery is perfect around 8-9 hours of onscreen time recharges quick as promised.Cameras are awesome no doubt about that.OS and UI are very smooth and easy to use.There are some issues which are to be looked after:1. The inbuilt fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't work quickly, I have to place my thumb 1-2 times in different position to get it work.2. Again the fingerprint sensor at night time when all lights are off and when you unlock ur phone with fingerprint sensor the screen brighten ups to it's fullest (like it's stealing my eyesight  )3. The night scape mode in camera it processes too long which is embarrassing when I'm showing off this features to friends4. The most important thing this is not actually an issue, but just a suggestion - I really miss the notification LED light, because every time I've to pick up the phone to check wether I have a notification or not or for what my phone had buzzed.There's a app called as NO LED available on play store which uses some pixels to color up and  show up in the lock screen but it's annoying I'm sure OnePlus can definitely come with a better app or solution.I'm sure this issues can easily resolved by the company in a software update.Thanks for reading.Overall it's the best phone for this budget range go for it and buy it.Update : finger print issue is resolved it's now quick	5
Moving from a Galaxy S8 to the Oneplus 6T might just be one of the best decisions in my lifem.ProsWonderful Screen (S8 had a higher resolution panel, but literally I've always used it on FullHD+)Great Battery (Easily lasts a day. On the other hand, S8 after one year of usage required to be charged at least thrice a day)Performance (It's fast, blazing fast! Whereas my S8 became Laggy just within 6 months of the purchase)Design (This is a personal preference. I love the matte finished glass )Software (Pure stock experience with some good OxygenOS tweaks. I love it. )Camera (Not up to Samsung standards but not far behind either)Price (Still a bang for your buck)ConsNo IP ratingNo headphone jackSpecial Mention :The In-Display fingerprint scanner looks cool. Pure showoff stuff. Slow but feels secure.I'd recommend the 8+128 combination. And it's Still a flagship killer to me.	5
Amazing phone.	5
I just loved the notch and battery life.1.Earlier had doubt about in display finger print but after using it, it is pretty cool.2.Also the gestures are convenient to use.Overall gr8 phone.3.Price could be little low then it would be beast.4.Sound quality is more than sufficient.	5
Everything seems to be good but the face unlock feature is not IR equipped to support face unlocking in the dark.The camera is ok but not great still needs to work on it's shutterspeed , I find there is a little delay in capturing pictures.Else other features are all good and phone works smooth without lagging	5
Sound quality is superb Mobile gets charged fast & lasts for longer period .Picture quality is also awesome ^_^	5
overall very good product by OnePlus this time. everything is just super enthusiastic.	5
I got this phone yesterday and this phone gets off on its own I just dont understand whats the issue and there no replacement policy as well I have to go through a long process to prove that the phone is not working properly..Disappointed!!!!!!	3
Amazing Phone. Total powerful performance phone. Excellent in every aspect. Fingerprint sensor needs some big improvement.b	5
amazing product.	5
Awesome phone. Super fast performance. Awesome photo quality. No complains	5
The best of it's kind with a really classy in screen finger print scanner and the camera quality is really awesome	5

Nice Product	5
Value for money and a performance beast.	5
Bestest ever phone. Super speed. Duo network.	5
OnePlus is the best.	5
Weight and thickness	4
Awesome phone	5
Very good	5
I have always been a One Plus fan. It's worth upgrading from 3T to 6T. Just loved it. Speed is very fast and you will feel when you play games. Camera is too good. Battery backup goes for a day with net.Overall, it's really a beautiful beast from One Plus.	5
Overall performance is good. It doesn't have dual speaker. 3 attempt required to download single app in play store	4
It was awesome....	5
Awesome phone midnight black is looks more beautiful	5
Value for money	5
It is best phone in the market ! Photos quality is awesome. It is up to the expectation of customer	5
Picture quality is great, night scape mode is wonderful maybe it could have made water resistant	5
Cool	5
Excellent speed ,no one can catch the speed	5
I got this phone with a minor scratches on the pre installed screen protector, however I'm not sure if those are on the protector or the screen itself. I couldnt file a complain since I am travelling constantly. Will obviously reach out you guys once I'm getting back home.	1
Performance	5
Not yet complety enjoy the joy of 6t but I love one plusAnd I not yet received ear phoneWhich is  offered for pre order bookingAnd cash back 1000	5
Everything is gud	5
Beats every other phone right now in terms of quality and reliabilityCon- Headphone jack.. Though you get the connector, it's kind of a irritating thingy to carry it everywhere you go	4
Great	5
Good	5
Awesome device.	4
I haven't seen any app in play store which can slow this phone down.	5
Superb Quality...But There is a problm if any one call you the Upper mic was so Vibrating.	5
You can't get a better finished and better quality product with such flagship features at better price! Don't compare this with other cheaper phone promising equal/better flagship features! They have a lot of cost cuttings and the experience suffers! Not with this device! There are hardly any compromises here! Except for the lack headphone-jack! A near perfect device!	5
Very expensive ..mi  seems a better choice with these features	3
Display 	5
Nice	5
1st time I buy the OnePlus 6t and its very high performance of mobile. Smooth and fast.Quality of mobile is superb.	5
Battery and sound quality was too good	5
Simply awesome in all areasLike touch, screen clarity, sound quality, battery backup, in screen finger touch detector.	5
I loved it more then Iphone	5
Best mobile	5
I have been HTC user for past 5 years. Compared to it, 6t has a good build quality. But when I use JBL headphones in 6t, it does not sound as good as HTC. Used multiple apps for it. Got best output from Amazon Music but not that great. Also, this phone is not at all for one hand operation, no matter which navigation option you use. Other than that, this phone is a Gem! Worth the money.	4
Crisp picture quality, impactful sound and an impressive battery life makes it a worthy investment. A blind buy for those who plan to upgrade to OnePlus from others...Fingerprint sensor, face unlock are exciting features but not indispensible.All in all its a fair deal if the base variant itself is 128gb!! What more can u ask for!!I'm happy...N yes...Thank you Amazon for the On time delivery..	5
This is my first One plus phone , and I am glad that I choose one plus 6t , superb phone.	5
Much exited before the product ..but not so much satisfied after arriving of the product..... better it satisfy me in coming days with there new camera features.	4
superb mobile	5
Phone is awesome.but why ear phones is not included.	5

Very Nice mobile worth to buy	5
Really nice phone only thing lacking is stereo speakers at this price "sound quality" rest is great...	4
Just bought....Wow in all aspects.Performance and speed is awesome but also it won't let you down to capture memories on the go..Very much happy....	5
Very good quality of picture, sound. Battery life can be reviewed only after a week usage, however so far long battery life experienced.	5
Sometimes missed the headphone jack while driving. Other than that this device is a superb package. Few things OnePlus users alone knows,especially in software tweaks done by OnePlus. Stop complaining about the things which are not in the phone(after knowing we buy) enjoy the beast.	5
Awesome phone really superb first of all camera extraordinary inbuilt fingerprint sensor little bit slow totally phone is awesome thank you Amazon	5
Excellent display. The notch looks good. Doesn't bother much.	5
Picture quality is awesome.	5
Already in love with this beauty. Switched from Apple to iOS. And I think I made a good decision. Amazon is as always a notch higher while delivering the order.	5
I have both the phones one plus 6 and 6t. Camera performance in one plus 6t  is not as good as one plus 6. Rest apprers to be okay as of now.	3
Price is somewhat more ..But I'm very happy with this 	5
Bought this phone overall I think goodOnly thing as of now ifound slow motion video..not good...it's blinking...donno it's only in my phone?	4
Great features. Amazingly fast	4

Ordered OnePlus 6T on Nov 2nd and recieved it on NoV 3rd. First thing is delivery by Amazon was very safe and quick.Phone looks elegantFingerprint sensor on screen works fine and it's easyPicture quality is amazing. Superb fast browsingI will review after few days of usage  again	5
Like in screen fingerprint sensor	5
Good	5
World' best phone.....	5
Very good product with prefect design, much better photo quality, sound quality and battery life as well and mainly no heating problem after continue use of full day. The display is awesome and the notch given above just makes the display perfect. Its my first OnePlus device and I am loving it. OnePlus has  taken care of many small things to statisfy the customer and I love the way they have developed  and design the product.After using for 3-4 days I did not find any cons in the mobile.Thanks to Amazon as well for super fast delivery in one day.	5
Its a great mobile but I am audio jack is with charging point is not good	4
Awesome camera and display quality , ..	5

Good	5
Rate	5
My phone is not having any ringtone.this functionality is not working I have already reported and asked for replacement. Further the set was also not having the pin for sim. It's a terrible experience. Expect immediate action from Amazon and one plus team for replacement of my phone.	2
I'm writing this after a complete one day use. First of all mobile looks very premium in hands. AMOLED display with notch is quite awesome. Sound output quality and call quality is good. Battery life for minimal users will be 1 and Half to 2 days. For users who browse and play games will be one day. 0-70% quick charge will happen in first 30-35 minutes and overall it takes 55mins to an hour time for full battery. An immediate security patch for better enhancements will be available. Camera quality is good pictures are coming out like awesome in all the modes. Upgraded from OnePlus 3 after two years of usage to 6t. Bought mobile for 25744 after exchange and other discounts. Phone is good at speed. Ram optimization is nice. Total available space will get is 113 GB out 128GB. You have OTG support. The Oxygen OS is terrific with customization. Will be having a default applied screen protector and also back case which is good available in box. One thing which I have noticed is the download speed from Jio SIM is bit slow for first 3 to 5 hours. After that don't know it picked up really well. Go for this phone when you need all the features at a minimum cost with premium feel.Will let you know more after usage.	4
The overall look ,the edge to edge screen , performance are quiet impressive and the inbuilt scanner looks a bit slow ,but along with face recognition it never looks disappointing .I feel Battery life may be a disappointment ,since they have sacrificed headphone jack too  and  with a bigger battery , it's always expected more .	4
Face unlock is work when you press unlock button or double tap on screen.Fingerprint sensor on screen is also pretty slowFor supporting background running apps is not good that much.Camera clearity is awesomeDisplay looks is also too goodIn the gaming perspective it's very good there is no lags	4
You sent without Sim reject pin and Headset in the packed box	5
Awesome like always	5
Excellent experience with the phone and very sleek and masterpiece creation you can say that.	5
Excellent phone only reqmt is headphone is not provided by the company.	5
It's all good	5
Best phone for who want flegship Phone in decent price .  Better then over price smartphones of other companies. I buy from Amazon with 1500 cash back  and 1000 Amazon pay belence during Amazon great Indian sell.Phone best profarm in all categories .	5
Awesome product , thanks Amazon	5
Unless picture ..sound and battery life it is not looking good as it's giving system UI error and hang in between working.maybe issue with this piece.	3
Awesome phone!! Thanks Amazon	5
In love with this phone, in-display fingerprint sensor works absolutely brilliant.	5
Worthy phone and highly value for money and still with this 6.4 inch display it feelS awesome to hold and much better feel than of s9 plus in user interface  The phone look amazingly super gorgeous fingerprint is quite fast and the sound quality is very good finaly the cam is awesome as in this price point	5
I got a defective product	1
Oneplus 6T is Awesome Phone..	5
Nice phone	4
Amazing!!!!	5
All good	5
Yes, it's NEVER SETTLE	5
Perfect phone. After using it for two days didn't find any flaw. The only thing which is bothering me is notification light.	5
Great phone	5
The phone is Legendary.Totally worth investing in this. Should be good for at least 3 years.I have purchased the 8GB+128GB combo and it's definitely worth the price.	5
Battery life is good. Picture and sound quality is ok	5
It's awesome.	5
Worth it	5
Phone is amazing,,battery life z good one,littile bit heavier phon,ovr ol quite good experience	4
Nice	5
Amazing	5
Super phone and little more improvement is needed to improve brightness of the display.	5
Excellent	5
Phone is awesome but after. November update it is giving an WiFi problem. Play store is not working properly	5
When I received the phone it was  showing mute status. I am unable to unmute it. I tried several methods but it doesn't allow. I can increase the media and alarm volume but not the ring. Since the time I received it, it's on mute. I am sharing the screen shot.	1
My first OnePlus. Too fast. Battery last 1.5 day. Finger print unlock is slow by few milliseconds anyways it's a beautiful implementation. Face unlock is lightning fast. Performance is unbeatable. Put the gaming mode on and nail your opponents. I don't use wired headphone so I don't care about 3.5mm jack unavailability. I don't want you to buy this coz I want to keep an edge over you. Camera... Bhai sab! Kia hi bolu... natural colours with excellent pixels. If you don't want this phone then get Huawei mate 20 pro .. isse accha Wahi h.	5
It's good in every aspect but battery life worries a bit....in the end it's superb phone in this range	5
Its simply amazing	5
Camera is not as expected ,1- Portrait mode doesn't have zoom option as google camera have. back 2nd 20mp camera is only for depth sensing..2- if u have even one plus 3 with google camera installed it taked better photos than 6T ..3- Focusing on many close small objects like sand, marble,etc camera takes if object clear n few blured & washed out even in center of photo .4- Night photo has improved n are noise free ..Sound-1-sound is same as op3,3t,5,5t only bass has improved ..sound  isnt load.Battery life-1- Great charging , Long lasting,easily will last for a day with doing all activities..Battery won't disappoint you..Thinking to upgrade, if u have 5 ,5t or 6 no need to upgrade just for a long display ..	4
Very much like the product	5
This is my first oneplus..  this is my second day.. till now there is no issues..Unbeatable SpeedGood BatteryGood soundAmazing displayGood camera.. OnePlus always ready for quality.. thank u	5
Nice phone	5
Awesome batrry life and night section on camera is superbbb...	5
The $550 OnePlus 6T makes me feel like I'm cheating in a world where top smartphones cost $750 or moreThe OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.	5
A typical One plus phone does everything well	5
Totally lives upto the name and the hype. If you can spare 40k for a mobile, just close your eyes and buy this beast. #Never_Settle	5
Nice mobile.....	4
Just love it..	5
I joined the OnePlus family with OnePlus 5T and the experience has always been amazing. A value for Money product.	5
Only one word..@THE BEAST.but it is more expensive in competition of now a days.Genuine review after 10 days of usage..Pros :great displayDash charger the beastFast and latest finger print readerloud speakerBetter cameras nd impressive slow motion videosGreat battery lifeBest design nd gorilla glass 6Cons:No innovation nd nothing newLoss of headphone jack(it's not a big issue for me)No ip ratingNo stereo speakersNo improvements in camera.. same as oneplus 6Not at all value for money mobile in my view	5
Everything is perfect according to my need.camera , graphics,speed with 8gb and 128 .rear and front both the camera are gud,u will love protraite mode ,even the inbulid fingerprint sensor as we are iphn user we are habitats of front fingure print.u can't beat the speed of the phn....m little bit disappointed regarding batter life ..if u use continusly it's will harldly get discharged in 10hrs ..Soo it's can only be happen when u r whole day free for eg.your week off days ..and u r continusly inside the phn..but overall it's perfect for me.	5
Just as described by the company.... Best flagship ever .. bt lacking in speed for inbuilt fingerprint scanner...nevertheless face unlock is quite fast	5
Best phone looks wise and super fast and picture perfect	5
Not worth of price	1
good	5
The real speed you need for a smart is delivered by One Plus as always.Nightascape feature is pretty handy in low light.Battery life is super.Better sound, could have been more.Camera is awesome.string manual mode.	5
Awesome	5
Loved it	5
Excellent product in every aspect... I am missing, notification light and better screen quality as compared to my old Samsung Galaxy note 8... Apart from these, this is excellent device with speed...	5
Picture quality is good but the battery drains faster compared to OnePlus 5	4
(Pictures and videos attached)(Star Rating out of 5)Phone Overall Rating:     Camera Quality Rating     Battery Backup     Speed/Performance:      Operating System:     Fingerprint Scanner:     Usability/Gestures,etc:      Sound Quality:      I reluctantly exchanged my note 4 for this but after weeks use, I feel this is awesome despite few glitchesMy Experience as a power user of phones:I bought this phone by using the exchange offer with the MI Note 4 that I had used for over two years. Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it: The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen. The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality. Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime. In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePluss dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isnt as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6s rear. Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming. Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle. Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source. Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel. Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing. Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41 which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28 but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!! Just a Notch: Its a huge improvement over OnePlus 6s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds. 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones. If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones. 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe thats why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery. The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached). But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.	4
Overall amazing product for the price point .. but now its on the edge. One plus has been slowly increasing prices year on year and now they are in INR40K range. Further one or more price hikes and people will start going back to Flagship companies. Lets hope they keep it as Value for money.Regarding phone:Superb edge to edge display & battery life  - No complaints here. 1080P screen is crisp enough and gives good battery life. Notch is actually just tiny camera and bottom chin has become further thinner.Software: Oxygen OS -  as usual its clean and gives stock experience with few customizations. Since phone has been just launched have experienced few bugs, but lets hope one plus gives quick updates to solve these.Build Quality/looks: Thumbs Up! to OnePlus. Glass black and body design does give premium feel. But somehow felt phone is on heavier side (I have switched from OnePlus5 to OnePlus6T and definitely there's noticeable difference in weight).Fingerprint scanner: Works well most of the times but not as fast as physical fingerprint scanners we have been used to of earlier phones. If screen gets smudgy you will have problem of unlocking device as it requires clean surface to work.Only cons, I have experienced in this phone are No headphone jack and LED notification light. Most useful part of LED light was of charging notification. Now you have to wake screen and check. For headphones you do get C-Type connector but as it sounds "No 3.5mm headphone Jack" -  nothing to describe here.But overall its a good package and still its a Value for money! You can go for it for sure.	4
Phone was perfect... But it's dual speaker .. right speaker not working..  m not getting what going on.. and not expecting this things ..	3
Nobody can solve the battery issue, it has nice back up but not better	4
Awesome phone I loved it	5
Best till date	5
Excellent	5
The oneplus 6t is the flagship killer really and having the latest technology latest GPU the latest CPU and the latest display display quality is good and the in screen fingerprint scanner is also very accurate and also the face scanner is also accurate talking of the prices I have bought the oneplus 6t 8GB RAM 128 GB storage by the way I was using S7 Edge before I bought the oneplus 6t and I am not really missing the S7 edge because the camera like S7 edge screen like S7 edge install in it and the latest Android version of course so recommended buy it!!! One plus 6T is extremely best mobile .I love one plus.I always appreciate amoz service.In amoz time and date is extremely good for any products diliverly.I love amoz.Thanks amoz and one plus 6t also.	5
One word for delivery- Superfast.About phone-Smooth, no lag time in opening the application.Super screen quality.No 3.5 mm jack but t-type jointer is given to attach 3.5mm wired headphone.	5
This is beast. Amazing performance. Fastest performance. You don't have to think before buying this phone. Just buy it man.	5
Good	5
OnePlus 6T is really a beast. The performance of this device is excellent. The AI makes the photos more real and natural in this device, also the sound quality is excellent as the two speakers at the bottom gives feel of headphone.	5
The best phone I have ever used....	5
The model one plus 6T is just amazing phone...	5
I am an old one plus user who used one plus 3 until I planned to upgrade to this beauty. I will keep it short and this is my honest review and feedback.Pros:1. 3700 mAh battery2. Corning gorilla glass 6 protection3. Bigger storage that starts from 128 GB4. New night mode that works like charm5. Touch and look and feel looks super awesome6. Oxygen OS 9 and Android pie works sleek and super fast7. Hidden flash for selfies8. In display finger print scanner9. Water drop notch which makes the phone look beautiful10. Dash charge is superb as always11. Gaming is awesome. It's sleek and seamlessCons:1. Same hardware as one plus 6 with slightly bigger battery and finger print scanner in display2. No 3.5 mm Jack for headphones which is surprising. Come on OnePlus, you could have adjusted it somewhere for sure. But guys there is a dash to 3.5 mm adapter that comes in the box so it's covered somewhere so don't crib about it3. No dual speakers in this price range4. Same camera configuration as one plus 65. Same 845 processor as one plus 6. Well this is latest and they didn't have any option6. The phone is not dust or water resistant. That's bad OnePlus7. Price of the phone is slightly higher (should have been 3-4 k less)All in all this phone is an all-rounder. If you could live without 3.5 mm Jack and adjust with indisplay finger print scanner then just go for it as the phone is a perfect treat to all the mid to high end users of a smartphone. You will love it.	4
Super Speed phone..wow! Thanks One plus team.	5
Camera quality is excellentOn screen finger print sensor is too goodGaming experience very smooth on phoneAudio quality too goodBattery life excellent	5
Sound low battery life not good for 3700 mh my one plus 5 battery is 3400 mh but this is nice but this phone is not good battery life may is software issue	4
I'm an iOS user for a very long time I recently bought s9 also but it wasn't good enough for me. OnePlus is seamless. I love it. At this price point these many good specs is really good.	5
Great phone with good software, camera and battery. Dash charging is fast. It will take only 1 hour 15 mins to full charge	5
It's awesome	5
Good	5
Amazing phone, premium to hold, just a piece of beauty, amazing camera and most of all value for money	5
This is very over priced phone as compare to other value for money phone like ASUS ZENFONE 5Z which provide 845 chipset at 25k and with headphone jack stereo spekar best display.......But other wise if you have money than it is nice phone but not value for money	5
Excellent	5
Superb phone.. mind blowing what this performance.. I fall in love with one plus 6t..	5
I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.Now onto the phone...Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.Conclusion:+Screen+Battery+Internals+Software+Camera+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer-no 3.5mm jack-no wireless charging (not important for me)BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!	5
Best phone of the year 2018! Battery is absolutely fantastic.. the phone is very smooth .. amazing display	5
Nothing	5
Great product !	5
Amazing product in this segment.Cool display!Amazing Fast Processor!Good Camera! (Best in Day light & with improved night mode)Actually its the Speed you Need!Best phone that challenges the high end flagships with a great price!	4
Oneplus 6T is definitely a flagship killer.	5
Battery life is much better compare to oneplus 6.Picture quality is same,i didnt find any difference.Doesn't have led notification,which is hard to understand you have messege and all.If you have oneplus 6, doesn't worth to upgrade.But as always fast and happy with phone	5
This is most expensive thing i have ever bought in my entire life and i really proud to have this beast in my pocket.this just perfect for me.Thank you one pluslove youThere not a single thing which it lacks.	5
Superb performance..	5
Really love everything about this mobile! Missing the headphone jack very much....camera quality great...battery life really good...sound from the monospeaker is loud and good which packs a punch...the fingerprint (indisplay) sensor is the coolfactor and you do even notice the notch!!	5
Absolutely Flagship3700 mah batterySnapdragon 845 beastIn display fingerprint decentFace unlocking faster i have ever seenUltimate package from one plusAbsolutely awesome phone loved it	5
Now satisfy	5
Best in class. Excellent performance	5
The phone is super fast and the low light photos are simple awesome 	5
I had 3 doubts before buying1. Speakers - they are loud enough almost as per many dual speaker phones2. Notch - this phone hides the notch pretty well.3. Headphone jack - easily survived 4 days with the adapter always fixed to my headphone wire. Now I don't even remember what headphone jack was. Also, adapter are available at very cheap rates everywhere.Phone is superb & please do not conpare it with poco. Oxygen OS is far superior.	5
Very good product with 2days delivery	4
The fon is bulky and its gliding on almost al the surfaces, but not preferable to b used without a case	2
I am not at all happy with the in display fingerprint sensor. Low light camera is not so good.. its just average..rest all the things are good enough.. the most imp. Charger is very fast.	4
Top notch all round performance!!	4
Life is short ,don't waste it in reading reviews ... If you have the budgetBUY THIS PHONE !!But since you have decided to read further ... Let's tell you more ...After days of research.After hours Gyaan from my gyaani frnz n geeksI finally settled on Never Settle.Constantly using this since last 48 hours. I am highlighting specific features over OP6.Pros :Speed : More than your expectations , u will not be disappointed even throwing maximum high RAM using apps , its RAM management is over the mark.Battery:Lasted on heavy usage for approx 7-8 hours.Fingerprint Scanner:Initially it required more firm pressure , but after 10-15 (at max) unlocks you just have to feather touch it. I have enrolled both thumbs and it works pretty smooth and blaze fast , I'm not using face unlock to test scanner more.)Oxygen OS : Makkhan hai ;)Display: Lit and bright even in broad daylight.Type C over 3.5 mm -Folks I would like to say we are reluctant to adapt this as we are so used to our traditional methods but remember it's technology and we should appreciate the change and upgrade our gadgets accordingly, which ofcourse is a dent to your pocket. Cutting it short I'm still using my apple 3.5mm earphones via the supplied connector and the quality is not compromised neither in the headphones or aux input to your multimedia systems, its loud and crystal clear.Cons:Camera is same as one plus 6Not so impressed with the night mode as its digitally optimising the continuous frames which blurs any moving object but the steady subject is quite clear ...Overall it has the same camera performance as one plus 6 . Which is awesome.End Note :Do the maths ;)Don't forget to put science, technology, innovation and a garnish of elegant design.If you have the budget (or likely to make a jugaad from friends n family :D ) own this ... I bet this bae won't disappoint you .N if you're a one plus 6 user.Wait for one plus 7 .For Amazon and Green MobilesFolks I would like to appreciate the fast secure and timely delivery of my prepaid package with all due precautions and using the tamper proof package.This no doubt increased my trust over online purchase of high value items prepaid.Thank You !!Reviewed On 6T ;)	5
Picture quality along with battery life is excellent but could improve more on sound quality	5
picture quality is just awesome .. sound and battery is too good ! value for money ... OnePlus 6T !! being a iphone user I must say oneplus 6t is much better den iPhone !!	5
Very desappointing on sound quality on both Bluetooth and earphone, I have LG BOM box and Bose sound link Bluetooth speaker, sound quality very poor in Bluetooth connectivity, it's also not support 2 Bluetooth speaker play simontiously like Samsung 8 , LG phone, honer play phone, tried LG , mi  and Sony earphone with phone sounds came very poor, only phone speaker quality is good.Reast display also not up to satisfaction level as compared with LG q7 thinq and Samsung galaxy series 8 and 9, Battery draining fast, no benefit on night scape feature in this phone, still front camera needs to improve, touch and phone speed is very good as like erlier OnePlus phone, but not getting anything new in this phone, appat from notch display, even touch finger sence some time not working, and not speed as like back finger sence earlier. Not recommended for music lover.	3
OnePlus is on right track to kill the Flagship Phones, and the legacy continues with 6T also. Considering the value for money, it is the best phone one can buy in Rs 50k.Now, Pros and Cons are -Pros --6.4 inches Super AMOLED display produces punchy and accurate colors with high dynamic range-Bigger screen to body ratio-Camera is superb for video recordings as helped by Electronic Image Stabilization, Night mode takes detailed photographs even if there is very low light(refer attached photo taken from Mi A1 and 6T simultaneously)-Snapdragon 845 provides lightning speed and I observed no lag while playing heavy games, video streamings and switching of apps.-Great customization tweaks offered by Oxygen OS that helps in basic needs.-DASH charger helps in charging phones upto 50-60% in 25-30 mins.-In display fingerprint scanner adds to looks and comfort of the phone.-Phone feels super premium, thanks to it's metal body and glass back. Comfortable to hold in hand.-Face recognition works like magic, even in night with no light source aroundCons--Portrait mode in camera produce photos with less recognizable blurring between subject and behind scene, sometimes missing focus on subject also.-I found battery backup to be on a little side compared to OP 6 inspite of larger battery housing.-Indisplay fingerprint scanner looks amazing but it takes a little time to unlock phone, however it is operable and becomes fast with every use.Thanks.	5
Battery life	5
Literally as they mentioned "Unlock The Speed". Very true. Phone is so good. After upgrading from OnePlus3T to OnePlus6T, I've been mesmerized by the phone camera. This is so cool. Compared to battery life, it's pretty better than the previous version, i.e - OnePlus3T. Battery is 3700 mAH polymer battery with fast charge.Colour display is also epic. . I chose Midnight Black. Looks Stunning. My games run so smoothly. PUBG runs like bullet. My overall review after accessing this Masterpiece. I've upgraded from OnePlus3T to OnePlus6T for the only purpose. That's Camera. Just class. The only thing that disappointed me that the OnePlus bullets wireless earphones wasn't included with it.Pros :* Battery life is good.* Good processor.* Amazing Performance.* Dual Camera with Portrait Mode & Studio Lighting.* Dash Charge. One day's charge within few hours.* Finger Scanner in display is Epic. Super fast. Cons :No Notification LEDOnePlus bullets wireless earphones not included with the package.Overall rating :Performance : 10/10Sound Quality : 10/10Screen size : 10/10Face Unlock : 10/10OS : 10/10Front Camera : 10/10Rear Camera : 10/10Battery : 9/10I was using OnePlus3T & I was waiting for a long time for this beast to come out. Features are beyond good & this is the best & powerful device so far for Android Versions. If you're seeking a phone that's fast & multitasking & upto the mark for speed & performance, this is the one as the processor is beyond Epic if you compare with other Android devices. One of the latest devices for Android platforms & at very affordable price. Totally worth. Truly I have no regrets buying this sexy beast.  Worth all your money Bought this with Acko protection plan & it's worth the deal.  Don't Hesitate. Go for it. Welcome to the Community everyone. Cheers. 	5

Top quality product yet again from One plus. I used it extensively for a day (without gaming) there was no heating and battery life was good.Gesture controls are an added advantage.Good camera quality. Could have provided Front flash.No slot for 3.5mm jack is bit of a compromise.	5
Just 1 word - Awesome	5
Awesome phone	5
Battery life	4
Everything is good, except speakers right side speakers are not working	4
I would like to tell it in one line ,"6T is awesome".	5
Awesome , Really I liked this device ...	5
Picture quality awesome.but price is a bit high since other mobile company are offering in low range.	5
Awesome phone by OnePlus.	5
I have not received headphones as promised by pre book OnePlus 6t	1
A great phone As expected...The tag line "UNLOCK THE SPEED"is really present.... Loved to have it...	5

Flashship killer	5
Truelly a killer in flagship Market. You will find worth applying your money on this product.	5
Pleasantly surprised with the buld quality (glasses). Very smooth to operate. Android pie is a gift to use... Rear camera quality is average in indoor shoots. But selfies are impressive.	5
Ihv no words for this mobile..its really superb. My 1st oneplus	5
Not a big improvement over one plus 6 but still a great phone.  Fingerprint scanner built inside the screen is just amazing.	5
Awesome Product	5
Very good phone. I bought 8gb ram phone. Phone is very smooth and fast. Soooo.... Never settle....	5
One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.	1
Simple & fast	5
Damaged	1
I bought onepluse6t product on 1st Nov and today my phone cameras are not working . Please consider my experience with OnePlus before you buying this product.	1
OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.ProsGreat battery lifeFluid performanceTop-end designImpressive rear cameraConsNo headphone jack'Only' full HD resolution	5
Very good design.looks very premium.fast charging does an amazing job.sound is not louder and clear.Display could have been better.Third party video player affects the video quality.If the same video watched in YouTube in same resolution it seems very much good.	5
Good phone but not best.... but delivery was superfast, order in morning 9 am and delivery in evening 7pm	5
Great phone with awesome looks. I am really happy with purchase of Oneplus 6T.	5
Just buy it.	5
Best flagship phone for the value	5
awesome flagship killer from Oneplus	5
Awesome	5
Good but night scape not working well	5
I've moved from 1+3 to 6t, it's a wonderful experience but I'm missing the good old things like notification led and many quick settings on long press/double tap etc.. not sure why OnePlus removed these! Overall I'm happy..	5
Sound is good but not great .Battery life is very good .It is bit heavy but overall the best Android phone till date .	5
Just awesome. Thank OnePlus & Amazon.	5
Dear friends finally I got very good phone Really superb performance. I am liking battery performance,display, touch( feels like iPhone),superfast, quick finger print scanner, quick face unlock., Sound output). No worry on transferring  my files from old phone, one plus switch app. taken care. One word to say is  'awesome'. Also please note that phone comes in silent mode on receipt. The selection switch above the wakeup switch to be used to bring back to normal mode.	5
Hey everyone.pros: In brief 6T is OnePlus 6 + IDF + extended battery+Tear drop.Cons:1. It is not that much handy as OP6 was. It does not fit good in hand.2. Still no stereo speakers added. Even after removing 3.5 mm jack.3. No IP rating mentioned by the company.4. Bulkier and even thicker than OP6 .	4
Xlent Mobile	5
Best phone available on planner	5

Great product quick delivery. Overall awesome 	5
Almost everything is quit good in this range, just missing headphone jack.	5
It's a machine worth paying for. 	5
Awesome phone but still have room to improve in interface	5
It's good as like old lunches oneplus again produced flagships killer.	5
Awesome 	5
Battery life is better. Picture quality is good. Sound quality is also reasonably good but definitely not the best among its competitors. Having said that, this phone is really really fast. Display is awesome. Dash charger is wow as usual.	5
Loved it absolutely	5

Awesome phone just the finger scanner is talking 2 to 3 sec to unlock	5
Best smartphone in 2018 . Battery life is awesome and picture quality and all over performance is awesome fully satisfied !!!!	5
I'm using this phone since yesterday. First time I m using one plus and I really liked this phone.. what I liked most of this phone is face unlock speed.. it's amazing. less than a second it's open. There are lot of features in it when u play around with this phone.. camera quality is awesome.. I just loved this phone... 1 drawback is battery, it should be 4000mah but since it has type c charger , phone charges quickly..	5
8g/256gb. Best gaming experience so far. No lag and UI is amazing.adding unedited camera sample.Bottom facing speaker will get blocked while playing games. However not big issue since this is common with all phones with speaker at the bottom.	5
After one plus one to one plus 6t.. Wonderful feeling. Amazing phone. Best build quality, fast charging, futuristic finger print lock. And amazing camera. Go for it.	5
Satisfied .!!	5
Excellent mobile	5
Delay delivery by Amazon but phone is worth to buy go one plus	5
Well, here is my feedback!1) One thing has disappointed me i.e. it doesn't have any headphone jack!!2) It doesn't have any expansion slot.2) Picture quality, internal storage, sound quality and battery life are really good.3) Furthermore, it has a good fingerprint scanner and face unlock system. If anyone wants to buy a new mobile, she/he can definitely go for OP6T!	5
If you are a op5,op5t or op6 user it is not worth upgradingcons of oneplus 6t:1 the indisplay fingerprint is way too slow and does not work always2 the phone still has some network connectivity issues(s/w upgrades may fix them)3 phone works fast BUT expensive for the price and lacks good features like IR blaster,gloves mode, only limited gestures4 it seems interesting for a week, later its just a normal budget phone5 the low light photos in 'nightscape' is still bad,overall camera is just OK(not as hyped )Pros:1 Phone feels more premium than Rs.25,000 phones but still does not provide the vibe of apple or samsung(note & S series)2 has good customer care support (especially online)3  the software(oxygen OS) is really smooth,no lags at allfor those looking for phones for at least 2-3 years of usage,if possible wait for oneplus 7hope to see a triple rear camera and 5G on oneplus7	4
Got the phone today and my-oh-my, what a beautiful piece.. I love the design but just one thing that the screen curve is a bit too overdone.. it's a lot of curve for this beauty.The phone is snappy and you can choose to remove the animations and make it look faster than it already is out of the box.The photos come of pretty well, compared to the high end flagships, it could have done with a better camera.The UI is as always smooth and sharp with animations you'd love to see.I suggest the fingerprint scanner icon could be used as an animation LED for notifications as it doesn't have one.Overall an amazing buy!Thumbs up to OnePlus	5
I had prebooked the phone but didn't get the earphones, are they coming in later or something?	5
My first one plus...Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding.  Thank you Amazon for super fast delivery.	5
Crystal clear picture quality and long battery life.Overall experiencing the magic of 6T.Super fast delivery by Amazon!!!!!!!!	5
If you have OnePlus 3, or other phones then this is worthy phone	5
Good	4
Awesome phone  to use, incredibly fast, Ambient display heavily drain battery.Flickr issue on slow motion video which could be fixed by OTA update.	5
Nice	5
Good	5
Dis is 1 of da best smartphones in Android!It has almost all da features wich iPhone XS, XR, XS Max, Samsung S9 or Samsung Note 8 offers.Luk at da price tag. I bought it for Rs 35K (after discounts/cashback).Ull get da same features in iPhone or Samsung but u need to shell out Rs 50+ for Samsung & Rs 80K+ for iPhone.Fingrprint unlock inside da screen is da feature wich none of da smartphones hav 2 dis moment!Display is so colourful, crisp, vivid n amazing. Definitely worth da price!Da only feature it doesnt hav is da stereo speaker wich I believe One+ will add it in upcoming models!Go for it!	5
On screen fingerprint is fab	5
Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.	4
OnePlus 6T is best smartphone.. it just going to rock 2018!!	5
Really loved the gestures but phone is very heavy	5
Impressive no doubts!!!! Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phoneAWESOME....#NeverSettle	5
Already in love with one plus from past one year..now bought 6T by exchanging my 5T 3 days back and now totally in love with my new one plus 6T..Finger print unlock is just brilliant & it's working absolutely fine..Night mode feature in camera is awesome.. you'll get excellent pictures and software is simply superb.Tried playing multiple high end games without any lags.The only drawback which I felt is lack of ked notification light (Being one plus user from past one year, will miss this feature), rest everything is perfect.Got my device at the best price, thanks Amazon for superfast delivery i:e in just 7 hours after placing the order	5
Love it.	5
Amazing product	5
One of the best phones I have used till date, you will not regret buying it.Let's talk about the pros first:Clean UI and blazing speed:Speed and clean UI is the best in class when comes to OnePlus devices, one of the best UI I have used till now. Performance is only next to iPhone xs max and mate 20 pro, however these devices are much costlier than 6tDisplay:It's fricking good , one of the best full HD display in this rangeIn display finger print scanner:Guys, this is so so good, it's very fast, not lagging as mentioned in other reviewsBattery:Again a department where OnePlus 6t takes a big leap. I have been using poco F1 with 4000 mih battery, but 6t with 3700 mih lasts longer than poco F1.Camera:Camera is better than poco F1, however the night mode of 6t cannot be compared with pixel 3( you can take a shot in pitch dark), this is where OnePlus has to improve if it wants to become real flagship rather than being `flagship killer`.  However I am happy with camera performance considering the price point.Cons:None - it would be unfair to mention anything in cons as I don't find any.Final verdict: OnePlus has put in their heart and soul in making 6t .	5
I had bought one plus 6t on next to the launch day and overall performance of the device is good with updated and upgraded features with enhanced software updates for camera like nights cape and studio mode.All I was little disappointed is that this time OnePlus 6t doesn't even bothered about internal or external audio.There was no 3mm Jack and external audio is really bad like China mobile sets and it doesn't have stereo speakers for it.Fingerprint sensor seems to be little delay and there was no option to disable the fingerprint light effect.As coming to Type-C to 3mm connector jack is very delicate and it won't last for long time the who use 3mm headphones using this Jack.	4
It's amazing device , picture quality is good but when the zoom at the maximum ,show pixel out , Sound quality is Nice , and battery life is good	5
Awesome phone with great battery life and camera, with better design too.	5
The second oneplus mobile for me oneplus five awesome .on nov 3 I gt oneplus 6t in kerala 2 day use 6t also awesome	5
Nice phone	5
No words for this beast just buy n experience its power	5
I feel this phone is better than apple iphone series as it is cost effective and the best in the market in term of its features also. Thank you one plus for this amazing expierence. :)	5
Just got my oneplus 6t ausome speed ,best camera .worth buying this product	5
More than expectation	5
Camera is awesome and the battery life is good	5
Best phone of recent times if you not compare with OnePlus 6...	5
I received the phone on 2nd Nov, in these 2 days, I don't have any issues in the phone, performance is smooth and battery life is quite good. The camera quality is great. Overall best of this segment.	5
Very nice phone, just missing the 3.5mm jack. Overall a very good value for money	5
this is fukkknnn awesome. go for it.	5
Best in class mobile really happy with the performance... don't think just go for it	5
Really great one plus 6t. Once again an another winning journey of one plus phones. Great hearts off one plus team....	5
The Best option at 35-45k.	5
Fingerprint sensor is a bit lagging very minute when compared to the other siblings of Oneplus,other than the onscreen fingerprint everything is really fabulous. Even the fingerprint is awesome but you can sense the lag a bit.(+)	5
Beast Gaming mobile	5
Picture quality and sound quality are good, but when it comes to battery life, can't decide anything now. Will update after few days. But over all the phone is a beast!	5
The best part of the phone is its display along with the in display fingerprint sensor and the aesthetically pleasing notch.  Battery life has improved quite a bit from the last gen op5t and 6. Oxygen OS continuee to be the best android experience imo. Only if they could have been a little more aggressive about the pricing, it would be a bang for the buck. Camera quality is decent but expected bit more of it. Video quality is great.	5
One of the best phone in the market... I must say its  a killer flagship and fastest mobile phone in the market.	5
The best choice.I prefer OnePlus 6T over POCO.I feel it's worth every penny.	5
Total wastage of 38k. Amazon has hired all paid jerks to promote this phone. I ordered it on 1 Nov at 12.05 AM and got it on 2 Nov.  Since two days I am totally unsettled. 3700 mah battery drains in half day even though I am not a heavy user. Call Volume is very very low. I have to sort of penetrate phone into my ears to hear other side. It also hanged few times while using WhatsApp. 1Password is not working properly. Google assistant stops working anytime without any changes in settings. In fact any setting can change automatically.  I am heart broken. I have been an iPhone user for a long time. With this phone is decided to move to Android but I am unsettled . I want refund but Amazon is denying. Blind and reckless promotion by Amazon is forcing the people to buy it. They have hired all paid jerks to promote it.	1
earphones not received in package. when will we get the free earphones	3
I'm in love with this phone. Amazing picture quality, tremendous sound quality and battery life. And not to forget the GAMING MODE. Value for money...	5
Phone is superbI purchase 6+128gbIt play like liquidIt mean smooth performanceGo for it blindlyBy regular use of game internet youtube n song. It gives a day performance battery even at midnight there is still 22% pending battery.Battery performance is good too and fingerprint is like wow yaar.it feel wow 	5
I just unlocked the speed today but it disappointed me I can't download apps it takes forever to download for a brand which promotes that it is very fast really disappointed.the battery also drains really fast really disappointed with the phone .I don't recommend this phone at all it also force close few apps after normal use of apps	1
If u r thinking about it, just buy it. Best value for money, no doubt, period.	5
Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working	1
Just go for it guys.. best phone in dis range	5
All the features of this Mobile is awesome	5
I haven't used any android device which is this much fast user friendly.Best android smart phone.	5
Pros:1. Battery life2. Display quality3. Performance4. Fluid Navigation gestures5. Best implementation of notchCons:1. Missing 3.5 headphone jack2. This phone is not officially IP67/IP68 certified	5
Happy to have one plus 6t. . . Full Paisa wasool	5
Picture quality, Sound and Battery is good.Face detection is really working good.ConsFinger print detection is hardly working. otherwise value for money.	4
I own a OPO, OP3T, OP5T now this OP6T.I feel OP5T was much better phone than this one. The battery on this drains faster than OP5T. This one is big, bulk and heavier as well. I don't find it any better than the OP5T for day to day usage.	3
Only one defct.....3.5 I miss u.....overoll good	5
pl do software update on receipt. we can feel a lot of change in phone performance by this	5
Picture quality and sound quality is ok.but battery  seems draining fast.I received mobile yesterday, after full charge I just used for about 6 hours of mobile battery is reduced 100% to 26%.Need to check further	5
I like it very muchBuild quality awesomeAmoled Display Excellent battery lifeOverall good performanceIf u have any old device want to upgradeCan go for it blindly.	5
Performance of the phones is quite fast than any of the phone. Face unlocking is super fast. Complete package one would expect from one plus.	5

Phone is completely awesome..... overall good specifications.... definitely you can go for this device in this price range......I got this device for 35000......	5
Today is the special day for me because I ordered one plus device for the first time. I'm really excited to explore this BEAST. I just used it for couple of minutes. For now I can't say about the phone's pros and cons.  Build quality is really awesome, In hand it's feels very premium device. Water drop notch is also a trend. Camera quality is outstanding. Overall it's impressed me.  Speaker output is not so loud. 3.5mm Head phone jack is not there but You got a dongle in the box. In one word I am satisfied.	5
Impressive. Outstanding picture quality.	5
Amazing phone...the title "Unlock Speed" is true to it's words. I have always been an Android person...but since One Plus 3 I have been a One Plus fan...and 6T has raised my expectations.	5
very poor product from one plus and neither amazon is replacing the device battery didn't last long much not even 5 or 6 hours the device is malfunctioning like opening apps on it's own and volume is increasing or decreasing on it's ownnot satisfied with the product	1
Marvelous set	5
with every passing year Oneplus is getting better than its previous version. 6T is just amazing. worth going for it. it comes with cover and scratch guard so no need to buy anything. picture quality is just amazing. Was surprised to see manufacture address whcih is oppo mobile noida.	5
AI camera features could have been included	5
Awesome product with brilliant features	5
Best smartphone of the year 2018	5
Super speed ram and good battery life and  excellent camera	5
Unable to download from play store ..even after having adequate 4g data of jio and vodaphone,don't know why,spoken with technical advisor,they told me they will help me,but don't know how and when..worried	4
Phone is working very fast everything is properly functioning only front camera is not that much good as expected if you are using iPhone than don't go for Android because there is nothing better than crome mode in front camera of iPhone and if you want speed than this is perfect for this	5
battery is consumed pretty fast that is not expected out of 3700 mah but overall speed of the phone is good. Product quality is as par. Totally worth the money spent.	5
Great piece.. Great speed.. Picture quality awesome. Face recognition works better than expected.	5
Value for money...Best smartphone brand..	5
I received this phone 1 day before delivery date, truly mobile was rocked, beautiful, super... thanks to OnePlus and also Amazon	5
They should have kept the headphone jack	5
Not satisfied at all.Want to return this product	1
Love you Amazon and Love You OnePlus...  Superb .. Awesome... Excellent... Overall proud and happy with Amazon teaming up with OnePlus..	5
After using it for a week! This is My first One plus mobile and I am really in love with this one. It's pure Android oxygen OS which gives you alot custom modifications. Camera is superb and sound quality is great with DiracHD. Finger print scanner is lit woke like a charm. Face unlock is excellent and fast. Many other Mobile's available at this price but none gives you this custom modifications and pure Android stock experience and dash charge is simply superb 0 to 100 in 1hr 10min.	5
Best smartphone in this rangeCamera - 10 on 10Speaker - Very loud and sound quality is good so 10Processor - Awesome 10 on 10Picture quality- very good 9.5 on 10Battery - Amazing 10 on 10Even though there is no audio input, no need to worry as one plus have provided usb type C to 3.5 mm cableSo not a big problem for me. You can continue using your old headphonePS -IT CAN ALSO RUN PUBG AT EXTREME HDR WITH NO LAG	5
Picture quality is top notch with limited notch	5
First time Onplus ExperienceCons:-Camera not satisfied at all.  Bad performance.-Notification sound adjustment not found.-Speaker quality poor and volume rockers are poor.-Vibrations. Even at high level poor performance.-Display brightness adjustment not satisfied compared to oneplus 6.-Primary Mic is not good. Tried in other OnePlus 6t as well. Same issue-Feels heavy. Can't play games for long time .Pros :-Speed and performance. No doubt .-Fingerprint is average but u will enjoy and get used to the speed.-Premium looks and display quality is good . Brightness adjustment is not satisfied.	3
What a phone.... you can't go wrong with this phone...oneplus for me is now just awesome smartphone makers	5
Worth or every single rupee	5
Picture quality is good. Performance is good.	5
What a phone... Awesome picture.... enough sound in loudspeaker... Battery life is pretty good ...	5
The OnePlus 6T is really a best with all trendy features...It was delivered on time and thus I was one of the very few people to hold OnePlus 6T so soon...The phone is premiy looking and also it feels great....Smaller notch makes it look awesome...The in display finger print sensor is quite fast and the animation for unlocking is complimenting it....Camera is same as OnePlus 6 and is a small optimized improvement over it....No headphone jack makes it less appealing for music lovers but in today's wireless world it may matter less....Battery is also bigger of 3700 mah and thus lasts longer for the day....I am quite disappointed for speaker as it is a mono speaker and thus does sound good to ears...Still all in all the OnePlus 6T is a trendy beast with premium looks and competitive pricing as compared to Samsung S9 qnd S9+ and Google pixel 2....	5
Amazing One plus Community Proved Never settle	5
Best battery life...observed. clear and sharp sound in the ear during calls. Great screen.	5
Not disappointed at all..finger print is only a bit issue.. everything else is excellent	5
Super	5
Facelock is amazing!! Loved the picture quality.Battery life is totally awesome.OnePlus tops again with its own kind.	5
The phone is blazing fast, and the face unlock function is just insane, underdisplay fringerprint works very good, animation takes little time,but not an issue, battery backup is also good, little dissatisfaction from camera category as the details are not  upto mark while zooming, else everything is great.	4
awesome mobile... fabulous picture quality, slow motion, night mode and royal look	5
slow motion effect giving blured videos black screen effect under lights of the room. dont know what problem is this	5
Picture quality is good. But not the best!! Also the loudspeaker is very loud and the quality is awesome. But, sadly it doesn't sport stereo speakers. If it would be stereo, then the sound quality might be unbeatable. The battery life is good enough!!	5
Pros:*Large 3700 mAh Battery for 8+ Hours of Screen on time*Large 6.41 Inch OLED Display which is Crisp and awesome with the best in class Sunlight Visibility*Dual Camera with Portrait Mode, Nights cape, Studio Lighting,*Android Pie with plenty of features, like Gaming mode, Reading mode, Slider etc*Dash Charge which give you quick charge of full phone within a few hours*Very Thin Bezels give you a premium look*Worlds Fastest In display Fingerprint scanner works like charm..*Buy it with the Instant Discount and cashback and free type c earphones at just Rs.33,500 Only (2000 Instant Disc, 1000 Cashback, 1490 Type C Earphones)*128 gb Storage for the base variant with 6Gb Ram this is the best.ConsNo Headphone jack and Notification LED.	4
Switched from iPhone 6 to One plus 6t and the it was the best decision ever!	5
Picture quality is awsmSound is loud and clear but Stereo Effect is missing	5
Using first time OnePlus phone.its amazing..camera is awesome..sound is good..the finger print sensor is good..the phone comes with a pre applied screen.and a back cover..which is good.I am loving it..the big screen.and the speed is awesome..never settle...it satisfy the tag line...	5
Good one	5
Fantastic phone just beyond the expectations.. 4 stars given for parcel box was damaged else phone is worth of money.	4
Why I have given 3 stars sound is so loud were it's not that adorable.	5
Osmm phone ...loved it	5
Awesome phone ..Thank you Amazon for early deliveryI got the phone just after 2 days of ordering..Really impressed by the color..Great speed..Charging is superfast like the OnePlus claimed to beThe device gives a great feel or comfort in you handVery convenient to hold and useSound quality is god, but could have been better with dual speaker on both the sides of the phoneAt the end this is a great pakage at this price ...	5
Superb	5
I ordered OnePlus 6T on the day of launch. Amazon delivered in a day. Wonderful, as usual.The phone is blazing fast and it's positives are well documented across review websites and blogs. I am covering just my 1 day of initial experience with the phone.UNBOXING - The package has a phone, charger, a 3.5 mm jack to Type C converter, a silicon case. The phone has a screen protector already fixed hence doesn't need another.Type C converter is very useful for those using wired earphones. I use OneMore triple driver and this converter is handy.BUILT - I have upgraded from Oneplus 3. There was nothing wrong with my previous phone just that couldn't resist upgrading. My OP3 feels slightly sleeker than this one. I must say I like the metal back of OP3 as compared to this. The rest of it is pretty good.SCREEN - OP6T is clearly well ahead on this count. The resolution is better and so is the color quality. The difference can clearly be felt on pictures.DATA Transfer - there is an OP switch app on playstore. Use that and it works like a charm. 36GB moved in 37 minutes with zero loss. Contacts, SMS, logs, media, apps, accounts, etc. For other phones upgrades too there are apps available.NO 3.5 mm jack - I am a fan of my wired ear phones (I invested in OneMore triple driver which cost 9k) Convertor is a useful tool but the main issue is you can either charge the phone or use the earphones but not both at the same time.No NOTIFICATION LED - I miss the fact that I could just glance from far to my phone and know that it needs to be seen. Here I have to lift and open it.IN SCREEN FINGERPRINT - Saves some screen estate for sure and makes the screen feel larger. However it's not as fast and efficient as the hardware finger print. Also, hardware finger print works the moment u place the finger on it even when phone is asleep. Here u move the phone, it activates the screen and then u finger scan. Small advise - activate 'double tap to wake' and 'face unlock' and 'ok Google' so that u have multiple options to unlock the phone.All in all, I still find the phone well worth to posses specially for the camera. I am a happy user.	5
Its just a cool experience using this phone, all the animations are snappy and quick, gaming performance is awesome and more importantly the customizations available, just makes this one of a kind top notch performance unit.	5
Best flagship till date.. Works well.. Battery is damn gud till now	4
Amazing experience !!	5
Waited long for this phone to get launched and it was worth it. I am not a phone connoisseur but can say it's crazy fast,l. Faster than my every old phone. It's third day I have been using it and I have a few pros and cons to share so far,Pros,- Super fast. You click and it happens before you wink. You can feel Snapdragon 845.- Immersive screen. It's crazy 6.41" AMOLED edge to edge display with beautiful colors.- Nightscape feature is really great. I have added a couple of images taken in night at a local fair for reference.- Battery is great.- Side slider button for turning the phone on ring, vibration and silent mode is so cool.- Updates for next 2 years assured.- The new Oxygen OS is excellent and flawless.Cons,- No 3.5 mm jack. They removed it to make room for on-screen FP sensor. An on screen sensor itself looks as a downgrade as it is not as efficient as regular sensor. OnePlus basically removed a thing we liked and replaced it with the thing we don't like.- Dash charger is too big. It's so wide that it sometimes covers the switch next to the socket which makes it difficult to turn charging on.- Face recognition doesn't work in complete dark and on-screen fingerprint sensor also struggles to identify your fingerprints in dark.- If in dark you don't want to disturb someone else with light, you shouldn't use fingerprint sensor as it illuminates the screen at sensor area to be able to recognize your finger.Verdict: It's an excellent phone Despite of few cons I give it full marks. It's a good buy. Happy to have OnePlus 6T as my daily driver.	5
Superfast face unlock,Fullscreen front flash,Nice speed,Superfast charging, &Good battery life.Value for money enjoying it.	5
This phone is awesome. Just i am concerned about battery life otherwise everything about phone is awesome.	5
One plus 6t awesome	5
1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product.	1
Night mode perform quite well .	5

Hello Guys,I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.1-  battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed  in 20k phone easily.5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.I am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good. Now choices upto you.	3
The only thing missing is 3.5 mm audio jack. Rest is ultimate.	5
Heating issues during charging time and internet access and downloading time heating mobile	1
Compared to other smartphones in the market Oneplus 6t is worth buying.I got it for Rs 31000 after all the discounts and offers which is satisfying !	4
Fantastic device. Worth the money.	5
Speaker should have been dual	5
Hello, I am enjoying the OnePlus 6T experience too, this is my first flagship phone so everything is off the charts for me.OS is light and packs everything I ever needed, screen is gorgeous, the feel is premium , camera is top notch.There is no notification LED , which I thought was a short coming but I soon realized it is a rather distracting feature, with my old phone, Everytime I saw the light, I'd jump at the opportunity to see what's up , with the 6T I don't have to unlock the phone every 30 secs, which some how improves my productivity  keeps me focused on the thing I'm doing.Oh and the charging is freaking aaaammmaaazing.This is my review.Regards,Derrick	5
It's my first 1+ plus mobile.... excellent phone with reasonable price.I'm1) Display 2) Fast charge 3) Battery4) Performance 5) Indisplay finger print 6) Updates7) Headphone jack (3.5 mm jack missing)8) Speakers9) Camera photo FC&BC  10) Camera video 11) Camera slow motion video I'm not happy with only two things in this mobile is low light videos & slow motion video quality while shooting with camera.I hope next update can fix this.	4
Nice mobile, worth it	4
Performance is good but back penal is not properly fitted. Called Amazon for replacement don't  know whether phone will be replaced or not.Sometime feels I shouldn't have bought it. Tried to Return it.. but no return option with oneplus. However, there is an option to return till 12 November.. (they should have replace the word "return" with "replace"Phone is damn heavy.	1
They are telling it comes. With strongest back glass, on the first day itself, for a drop from 4 feet hieght my phone got a new back shattered glass	1
Thank you Amazon and darshita electronics for the package. OnePlus 6T is amazing, user friendly .... everything good about this product. #neversettle	5
Best mobile ever I seen.. everything is just awesome friends don't think anything just go for it	5

Wow,,away some product  but I can't receive headfone ,,,pls,solve my problemsThanks	5
Hope camera improve wid updates...as my expectations r more, and in-diaplay fingerprint too slow and u hav to adjust finger properly then it work... Otherwise it deserve 5star.	4
An awesome experience with Camera, Gaming, Speed. Unlocks real fast with Face Detection and Indisplay Fingerprint sensor. Glad to be a part of Oneplus Family :)It would be nice if next update for camera brings AI Stickers as well for Oneplus 6T	5
One+ is now a brand that is giving tough fight to Samsung  and Apple devices. With the launch of one+ 6t, one+ proved itself yet again that why it is capable of ruling the market and capturing market share in mobile segment not only in India but all over the world. Now coming to device performance.1) fast AF.2) absolutely amazing performance3) great camera with improved software to push and get the maximum out of it.4) gives you premium feelingBuy it blindly I highly recommend to each and every one to buy off this phone if you are looking forward to get a new phone for yourself.	5
Worst product i ordered on 1st november 2018 at 00.01 hours i got the product but only ised 1 day and now the phone is not charging and the phone is dead.Dint expect such a baaaaaaddd  product.I always used one plus but from now onwardd no one plus	1
Totally loving the device, camera works beautifully with low light also, take awesome pictures. Selfie also come clean and sharp. 6gb ram can run two demanding games simultaneously in split screen without any lag. Apps looks nice on bigger screen, even videos looks great with sharp viewing angles and bright colors.Dash charge, charges very fast keeping the battery long enough for 8-9 hours for heavy users.In display fingerprint works like charm with beautiful animation but doesn't seem to be faster than previous type of scanner. Though face unlock is more faster than all.Only downside is from software side, oxygen os is very fluid and smooth, 1)android pie has its issues, adaptive brightness automatically shift itself to lowest light every time screen goes off. So need update on that side.People were complaint so much about 3.5 jack but i think very much manageable with the adapter provided	5
Unbelievable phone 	5
Very nice phone, but yet to receive cash back of rupees 1000/- as advertised	5
NOTE:@ Try to buy it in ongoing sale for best price.@ If you are normal or even heavy user, then just go for 6GB variant. Its more than enough to handle almost everything.After using this smartphone for more than 24 hours, following are the observations, If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review # Awesome Build quality.# Great Infinity Display with Crystal Clear output ( ~86% screen to body ratio )# Above average Camera quality.# Insane Battery Backup.# Flawless in Multitasking ( No Lags detected at all )# Sufficiently Large memory.# Lightening Fast in-display Finger print scanner.# Even faster Face unlock.DETAILED REVIEW -->===============BUILD QUALITY :-----------------------1. Build Quality is Great and it looks very Rigid.2. Light Weight about 185g considering the size of phone.3. Glass Finish looks very Premium, but is strong finger print magnet.4. Has Corning Gorilla Glass 6.5. Fingerprint sensor is Lightening Fast.PROCESSOR & MEMORY :--------------------------------------1. Have 2.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 octa core processor with Adreno 630 Graphics Unit.2. This Processor perfectly balance the Battery life & Performance.3. 6GB Ram is great and handles Heavy Multitasking seamlessly.4. Has 128GB in-built memory, which is more than sufficient.5. Supports Android Oreo out of the box.DISPLAY :--------------1. Screen is 6.42 inches Optic AMOLED display with Corning Gorilla Glass 6.2. Has Awesome Viewing Angles.3. Brightness is also well balanced with the Pixel density.4. Has good screen to Body ratio ( ~86% ).# Has decent Pixel Density ~402 ppi which gives crystal Clear display output.5. In display finger print scanner is the USP of this device and stands out with the amazing unlock animation.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :--------------------------------------1. Charged from 45 to 100% in just 1hour with stock charger.2. This is so far Quickest Charging Time available in any smartphone.3. Its being over 28 hours now since the full charge, and battery has drained only 29%.* In this meantime, I have kept the 4G ON continuously ( JIO 4G ).4. I got screen time of 2 hours, so far. So by this equation, I shall get over 8 hours of screen time with 4G continuously ON and over 2 Days of Standby time.*** I will update the battery performance after more detailed results.CAMERA QUALITY :---------------------------This is the section were I am Disappointed.1. Night mode is Disaster and certainly not for the on the go users.* A single snap in this mode takes from 5secs to 15secs, and any single movement distorts the image.2. Photos in normal mode are much better.3. Video recording is upto 4K 60 FPS which is good, but there's NO Slow motion.4. Portrait mode also looks similar to previous version.5. Front selfie camera is also not very impressive. Its Not at all worth the 38k price tag.CONNECTIVITY :----------------------So far I used JIO sim card alone and was facing issue while downloading.1. Calling is fine.2. Web browsing is also fine.3. But downloading speed used to fluctuate from 10kbps to 700kbps, very frequently.* Frequency of speed variation was way to much.OTHER FEATURES :----------------------------1. Finger Print Sensor is Lightening Fast.2. Games like PUBG works buttery smooth even at Ultra High settings.CONS :------1. Camera is Not impressive.2. NO earphone jack.3. Ram Consumption by System apps. is above moderate.4. Phone is very Slippery and prone to complete Damage if falls.5. Phone is literally finger print magnet.VERDICT :--------------Considering the price and the feature, if you get it for 38K, then don't go for it. Its not worth that price.I got this phone at 3k less and plus I got type -C earphone Free, so if you are going to get any discount, then only go for it. Else better go for something else.	5
Amazing build quality, snapdragon works smoothly.Great look, battery life amazing.	5
The phone is just amazing.The fingerprint sensor needs some improvement , but the new UI makes the phone run like butter , it's totally amazing.The battery life has drastically improved due to the larger battery .	5
without any confusion and without any thinking buy this phone... it's amazing and batter than other premium phone	5
Good phone	5
Best phone ever used 	5
Excellent, paisa vasool	5
Bang bang bang	5
What a phone! Nice notch, nice in display fingerprint scanner. Rear and front camera is good as always best so far from one plus And the night scape mode in camera is awesome. I have never seen cool photos like one plus 6T taken in low light conditions. Nice speaker sound output, crystal clear sound. Processing is smooth. Oxygen os is great. Even games like pubg, clash of clans and asphalt 9 working smoothly on this device. 3700mah battery, wow have to charge only once in a day. All over a good bundle with heavenly specs. Worth buying it, value for your money. Don't buy any other phone go for the speed you need. Keep it up One plus.	5
Awesome mobile to purschase.	5
Nice phone I love you one plus 6t. Thank you one plus team and amzon for fast delivery.	5
Wow what a phone	5
Well my younger brother and I order 2 new phones on the same day ,ie:01Nov18 to see who have made a right choice! I oped to 1+6t &my brother got Vivo v11Pro. (I regret my choice) Camera:Both phones have a great Camera but vivo has that white'sh shade in photo that we usually see on oppo&vivo but I don't think that is a valid reason to say it's not as  1+.Build quality:1+ comes with glass back and looks much premium but Vivo's duel shade back is no looser tho.FaceUnlock Speed:I might sound wierd but I think Face unlock speed on vivo is twice as on 1+ and the phone never misses. Graphics:Both phone are euqal no one looses here. Battery: Without a single doubt in my mind I can say V11 is the winner here.(on a 100%charge on both phones we started playing PUBG on high graphics and full volume my 1+ was switched off after 6 round of games but V11 had 20% of juice left in it) and finally Price: I really really regret buying 6t instead of V11pro which has all the similar feature for almost half of the prize. I would recommend Vivo v11 pro any time to anyone.	4
I was using one plus 5, which was a beautiful , sleek and light weight phone. I had bought one plus 6T with great expectations but was disappointed to see it. It is thicker and  heavier and not comfortable to hold. Secondly I had to face problems in exchange offer. It appears that they want a new phone in exchange. Minor dent or scratch in my old LG G4 was not acceptable to the delivery person and I had to literally plead and convince him to recieve it and deliver one plus 6t to me. A day before the the delivery person did not gave me phone as the imei number was not matching. So I had to order it again. So overall it was not a very pleasant experience exchanging old phone for new via flipkart.	2
Awesome product in this range. Camera quality is to good	5
It was really good experience with this mobile phone and Amazon services.	5
Nice stylish look, Good quality sound, good on screen finger sensor ... Over all very happy with the quality u get in that price range. So value for money as compared with all other options u get in android as One plus is the only one phone I found with out any flaws I can report. Was using One plus 3 earlier no complaints for that too ... :)	5
It's very good in all the aspects. Camera is very good. Best phone till now...	5
Shifting from Samsung to OnePlus.Loved the speed and efficiency.Screen fingerprint unlock and face unlock super fast.Best phone in 2018 at this price.	5
I just loved the display, design, camera, battery & definitely speed. Upgraded from One+3 to 6T. Happy One plus customer.	5
Very nice and fantastic phn, the best smart phn till date, awesome camera good battery life	5
Best camera  and worth the price..Picture Quality is awesome.	5
Amazing phone from camera to in display finger print sensor.	5
Very good product and excellent quality. Great discounts	5
Love the product.	5
Received faulty piece of mobile, battery can't even last for 6 hours, I am going to return it	1
Must buy guys superb phone next day delivery by Amazon awsm funtion running smoothly	5
Great mobile phone, super fast performance	5
Too good! Worth purchase!	5
This is my first OnePlus phone and I am very happy with it. It feels so nice in the hand. After 1st full charge the battery lasted for around 30 hrs after watching 2 hrs of movie and continued use.On screen lock works like a charm. I was surprised with the speaker as it is big and powerful.	5
I didnt realize display is rounded. Looks odd.	2
1. Google Play does not work properly, apps are downloading after 3-4 attempts.2. Very Heavy and does not fit well in hands3. Very poor quality of preapplied screen guard. Bubbles came only after 30 minutes of usage4. Camera is very ordinary	1
Best phone to buy	5
I would say things which is not so known fron lal the reviews and videos. The phone take time to get used to, especially with the cover. the cover is thick enough to take away the sexy glass black look. But without the cover it is gorgeous.Also,the fingerprint sensor is neither too accurate nor fast. coming from oneplus 3, i feel fingerprint is a downgrade. but the animation is awesome and faceunlock is amazingly fast.Its really snappy and fast phone and 128Gigs of Memory is superb. gives phone enough space to function.The Nightscape is fantabulous. so precise and works so awesomely even in quite dark pictures. really worth itThe headphone jack removal is not a big thing for me, but it migut be for some who dont want to switch to usb type c headphones. but yes tbh, type c is the future and we gonna get used to it sooner or later.overall loved it and its quite classy in hand. the promotions and discount were great. go for it.	5
Loving the low light camera and other specs.  If they add wireless charging in this price range, then no one will buy other brand  phones. #Never Settlee	5
Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.	2
Excellent phone. Though i miss 3.5mm. Also slightly less bright than many out there, not sure if its a particular device thingy	5
Comparing to 6,6T does it  better The best of best The build quality in every spects it's amazing Definitely u should go n purchase this new one 	5
There is white light line on the left side of display.  Amazon send me defected item, as you see on the snap shot giving above. And Amazon says install smartckeck and take snap shot and send. They will see and not replacing my phone as they say we replace with in 10 days. Disgusting. It was my last item I purchased by Amazon.	1
The OnePlus 6T is an amazing product, with extreme value for money and an action-packed set of features. #NeverSettle	5
Pros1) Premium design2) Awesome Camera3) Blazing Fast speedCons1) Safe the mobile from thief	5
Simply an awesome phone!Glad to hold this wonderful phone in hand.Only this thing which dislike is 3.5 mm audio jack which is missing in this phone.! Even though adaptor is provided this is a huge disappointmentExcept for the audio jack, this is amazing. Worth for money.. I bought this for 36500 after availing discount from HDFC bank card.	5
Abouve expectations Great experience while using this	5
running very fast!!!!! Worth buy.	5
Excellent phone	5
I was using Samsung S9+ for last few months and after using this since last few days i can say that oneplus 6t experience is really good and better than Samsung in many ways be it new gestures or things like fingerprint sensor which is in screen so very convenient to use and snappy performance so in my view this is the best phone under 50K.	5
Stunning product from OnePlus. Best in class. Dashing look. Superb camera. Amazing sound. Eye catching display. Best In Display Fingerprint Scanner till date. Superfast delivery from amazon within 36 hours. OnePlus proves itself again. NEVER SETTLE	5
Love this phone but surprised to see LED Notification feature is removed	4
Awesome mobile	5
Oneplus 6t is super fast, smooth and it's really snappy..when it comes to display it's bigger and subtle and battery life is really good and with gaming mode in this phone it runs game super smooth with no lags at all and camera is capable of taking really good pictures nd capturing fine details, every mode in the camera works perfectly...so yeah basically this is an all rounder beast..so if you are looking for a smartphone that is worth every penny you spend then just go for it no need to think trust me bcoz considering the price it's a best deal you can get!	5
It's a beauty. Getting the hang of it.	5
Beast	5
Yes, i bought it. It is an upgrade from 3T to 6T and I do have Onplus 6 also. Compared these two and matched exactly the same for their attributes on the paper and their usage. What really feels good is the new tear drop or water drop notched display. I really like the way they placed it.Coming to Pros:1. It would be a massive upgrade if you're using 4gb ram or lower previously.2. Screen To Body ratio3. Processing speed of the CPU and GPU4. Tall looking screen than the wide screen.5. Finger print scanner under the screen is real quick. Ofcourse I would testing more on this and give some feedback OnePlus team.6. Face Unlock is much quicker than the Finger print scannerCons:One thing I really felt low was Sound Enhancement is not getting enabled when connected through bluetooth.NightScape mode is not upto the mark.That's it.I bet you'll love the mobile and battery life that it gives you.	5
Phone looks fantastic,Speed is awesome,no lacks found yet in 2 days, will share full review after 15days	5
Extremely smooth to use and unbelievable speed. Worth the wait and the money. Beautiful display, sound quality, screen, camera. Face unlock so fast that it surprises me. Go for it people!	5
Too good. The fingerprint sensor could have been better.	5
Very Good	5
Indisplay fingerprint scanner is way better than expected. Its really fast.Oxygen os is the best u can get in a smartphoneExtremely fluid and insanely fastTremendous battery lifeFantastic display being only full hdGreat great cameras if not best, certainly in top 5 cameras out thereDash charging charges 3700mah battery in same time which is unbelievable.An excellent phone in every aspect except some minor cons like single speaker,no wireless charging, no official ip rating. But these cons do not matter at all if we think practically.This phone is better than the high priced apples samsungs or pixels. Better in many many areas if not in all.	5
On screen finger print scanner is remarkable and a trend setter. Overall, a great product with these specifications especially low light photography	5
Performance looks Speed it's great  .......	5
Very good product that I ever seen	5
Great product one day delivery ....	5
Really features are good and worthy	4
THE MOBILE IS SO GOOD,FAST AND EVRY FEATURE IS WORKING SO WELL..IM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH ONEPLUS 6T	5
Worth all the hype!	5
Amazing phone with amazing priceI sold out my iPhone to buy this beautyJust loved it #neversettle	5
Unlock the Speed. Photography is very nice and very long lasting battery. I charged for 100% and running still since 2days and I use my phone literally always.	5
Amazon delivered this beauty ontime. This is my first OnePlus device and I am just loving it. The device is very smooth and performance is crisp. Only issue I am facing is with the battery life, it's draining very fast and surprisingly Google Play is consuming maximum power. I hope OnePlus will fix this with an update. Also, I am really impressed with the fast charging in this phone, it's superfast. Highly recommended.	5
As always, value for money and crisp performance.	5
Again, this is the Masterpiece from one of the best mobile companies out there!Just go for it if you are considering to get an android smartphone!	5
Phone gets heated too much while charging	3
1+ has proved it again. Have used Apple, Samsung and others..this is my first 1+ and I can say it's the best ever phone I have held in my hand till date. If you looking for a new phone..go ahead and buy it. Best part is this phone comes with a screen guard and back cover..so your phone will be safe right after unboxing and you do not need to Shell out extra from your pocket for these nitty gritty things.	5
Pros:-Great performance.-Top notch display.-Fingerprint reader is actually pretty fast ifyou set it up properly-Awesome battery life, I get around 10hours screen on time and you can get aday's charge in 30 mins of charging.-Oxygen os is the best software experienceyou can get on an Android phone hands down, and the navigation gestures are fluid and fun to use.-Cameras are just amazing , you can't tell any difference when you compare it with the pics taken in a pixel or a Samsung Galaxy. And it's it wayyy better than iphone cameras c:You can shoot videos upto 4k 60fps and it is very smooth and sharp.Front facing camera works well too ( get Google cam Port for the best portrait selfies, you're welcome)-Build quality is very good, best looking and feeling Android phone under 40k.Cons:- No headphone jack. RIP jack.but as long as you get the usb c bullets, you won't miss it at all, and you don't have to worry about using ur earphones while charging because you will hardly spend time charging this phone. Charge it when you wake up and get ready for the day and have a cup of coffee and it will be charged-No wireless charging, but hey dash charge -No major upgrades from the OnePlus 6, if you own a OP6, don't get this phone.  Wait for a 7 or 7t-No ip rating, but can survive a few dunks in the waterSo if you're okay with USB c audio and want a great looking phone which turns heads, but also perfoms like a Beast, you should absolutely get this phone, best Android phone you can get right now!	5
You can't go wrong with this phone. Great Phone at a Great Price, yeah I did the math Pocophone. Fingerprint and Battery upgrades 10/10	5
Good look performance	4
Awesome phone.	5
It's amazing. 	5
Amazing experience of using this phone.It's my dream phone.Oneplus 6T. I love it!!!	5
It's very good product to buy. Worth buying.	5
Awesome phone.. Don't think twice before purchasing it.. it has all the features with speed. Better than any other phone.. Camera is excellent.	5
You can never find something better in market than OnePlus. OnePlus 6T is just amazing the smoothness in operation n the underdisplay fingerprint is appreciable.	5
Awesome Phone	5
How I can use jio offer on this product, I am going to recharge my jio but not getting voucher Rs 150. Pl. education me how to utilize this offer. Call me 9096748162	5
Hey another review of the phone. This is about the battery life. I got this phone on 3rd afternoon. Initially I charged the phone to 90%.Then on 4th night I plugged the charger at 10% and till today 5th evening with all day of WiFi/4g and still have 20% battery.	5
This is my first one plus phone so I m might not know the plight of earlier users but for me the phone scores highly on all aspects.1. Fingerprint sensor: it takes some initial attempts to train the model. You'll feel that recognition is slow at first but once trained it works like butter.2. Camera: superb features added. Everything looks life like with the dual aperture camera. Front camera is extremely good too. Overall one of the best cameras in the industry.3. Battery: I charged it once on arrival and haven't recharged it in the past 2 days. In any case, powerbanks have become the norm.4. The speed: Android pi combined with an amazing processor. Watching a movie while tracking your food order has never been easier!5. Launch offers: so I guess the phone is worth 28-30k. That's why there have been so many launch offers. Wait for some time and then buy this beast.Some cons:1. It is a bit heavy.2. A bit pricey..	5
Super nice	5
I'm in love with everything that this phone provided but I'm not able to digest the missing of headphone jackThe performance is spectacular. The fastest phone on Android side of things at least.Camera is damn good and that night mode though Battery life is also extraordinary. I'm getting about 8 hours sit and with gaming like pubg 6-7 hoursScreen! Man this looks gorgeousBuilt quality is also perfect what you expect from oneplusUi is one of the best I've usedTotally one of the best phone you can buy at around 35-40k	5
Great phone, nice features set just as one plus 6.But having used oneplus 6 for a couple of months before buying this I would say that after a few days of using this the novelty has worn off, meaning that the basic difference between two phones which is of finger scanner is not a big deal after a few days into usage.Other than that the phone is rock solid,, better battery, don't miss the headphone jack, notch is smaller phone more heftier (good).A brilliantly packaged phone none the less.	5
Excellent Phone, great battery backup, only concern is indisplay finger print is little slow..	4
It is a beauty and a beast.	5
Happy to have this	5
The product fabulous. Performance is more of a beasty type. Snappy af. If you have the money to pay for 35~55k then def buy one plus . The delivery of the product via Amazon prime sucks  the delivery guy doesn't picked my call the whole day to ask the time for delivery. Product packaging is also well protected!	5
Omg this phone is really awesome I m planning to buy the iPhone Xs but my friend is using the OnePlus 6 phone so we decided to go to Apple store and compare OnePlus 6 and iPhone Xs and atlast I m shocked when I see the difference is almost nothing I am really happy with this OnePlus 6t thanks a lot Amazon and offcourse OnePlus company for this cheap and best phone and most for the quality they provide in the very cheap price thanks a lot OnePlus phone worth the money	5
Best Phone	5
Excellent mobile... Speed,design,camera,battery everything is good....	5
performance excellentPicture qualitySound qualityBattery lifeSingle word in oneplusAwesome	5
One plus is back with best. Thanks one plus for giving a great user experience.	5
Unlocked - The Speed 	5
Super	5
How can i explain my feelings, i love this phone.. top top topppp...If you don't worry about budget , just buy this mainly mirror black is super and zakaasss... Go for it you won't regret. Previous i was moto and redmi user. Now ONEPLUS. LOVE IT.	5
I just loved it.camera variations , pics quality, smooth operation, look n feel.. overall an awesome package	5
The one plus known for speed and the product is very good in speed	5
Awesome mobile never seen this type of quality in NY mobileThanks to @oneplusFor this awesome phone	5
--Awesome performance, since it is 6gb RAM.--Display is very big, and good look.--Camera quality is too good.--Finger print unlock is very fast.--Battery is good.--Great look.	5
Amazon Delivery is excellent as always. Got it delivered within a day, that too, to my native city(Non Metro, not Bangalore).Coming to phone itself, had ordered Mirror Black 8/128 GB variant.Pros:1. Excellent build quality2. Great fluid smooth Oxygen OS3. Display is gorgeous. Feels bit longer and tad narrower than OnePlus 6's screen. (Tech spec also says so.)4. Felt sound quality over earphones (JBL E1+) is great... Compared to my previous OnePlus2. Felt comparatively better than OnePlus6. Though I don't have any test result to show, I just heard sound effects of same song on both OnePlus6 and 6T, Base and clarity of music on OnePlus 6T just felt refined if not same.5. Camera. Just awesome. Nightscape is good in low light. Very snappy camera. They r soft features which r coming to OnePlus 6 anyway.6. In Display fingerprint, well it's a good tech. Works well most of the time,even though not as fast as physical sensor. Did a false unlock with non registered finger when I was testing . It happened just once. Bleeds bright light from the sensor area while unlocking,(well that's how it's technology work)which might be annoying during night with sleepy eyes. Face unlock works like a charm.Its even faster than Screen Unlock. Only downside is Face unlock is image based.hence require sufficient light on face to recognize you. Also, you need to turn on screen to unlock, unlike IR based sensor in iPhone X or Huawei Mate 20.7. PUBG game looks gorgeous with HDR and Ultra frame rate settings. No lag or stuttering whatsoever. Game runs fast n smooth with great graphics.Cons: (not many)1. In display fingerprint sensor even though worlds fastest among In Display sensors in terms of unlocking speed, need more polishing. Not as fast as physical. But u will not know much difference if u r coming from OnePlus2. Unlocking bleeds bright light on sensor area might be annoying at night.2. No Headphone jack might be deal breaker for some. But they give type c to 3.5mm adapter in box. So shud not be as much as deal breaker. Pre-Order will fetch u a type c headphones for free.3. Nothing else which I can think of now.	5
Best software experience ever.	5
Very good phone	5
Pros: 1.Processor 2.Ergonomics 3.Camera and Night scape mode 4.Superb battery life 5.Value for money guaranteedCons: Sometimes Inbuilt fingerprint is slow.	5
Everything amazing , just give a stereo speakers next time. Thanks OnePlus for great Phone.	5
Amezing mobile,,what a screen,much powerful performance,..must buy guys...very rock set...	5
Superb phone. Apple stands nowhere even near to it.	5

The fingerprint sensor is not always detecting properly. And there are few bugs, but not so critical.	4
My first One plus device fabulous phone Everything is premium just go for it	5
One plus rocks it again with 6T.Amazing PerformanceAmazing CameraAmazing PresenceAffordable PriceBetter UI	5
Super phone and regarding to the camera it's really amazing and dash charge it's taking 30 min to charge 100 percentage	5
The most anticipated phone of the year 2018 is here. And tell you what it meets all your expectations. This is my first phone which I buyed on first day of sale from Amazon 1 Nov 18.Water notch looks awesome and you get full screen size experience.In screen finger print sensor is good. The animation effet makes it feel better. Other features are in common or near to OnePlus 6 just some tweaks upgrade.Pros: - Price - Display - Rom/Ram 128 GB/6GB - Camera - Feels PremiumCons:- Speakers sound quality- No 3.5mm headphone jackOverall you get a great premium phone at a good price. Recommend !!!	5
SMART phone. Yeah this phone is actually deserves to be called as a smart phone. Very fast and stuffed with lots of tech. It's look is cherry on cake. Wide screen with  hd camera quality.	5
The phone is good also the delivery was on time as mentioned	5
Best smartphone in the world	5
The phone is fast. The finger print scanner works well.	5
Amazing	5
OP6T JUST AWSOME....	5
Great Phone	5
The weapon of mine. I am like prince who found his right sword. This beast phone is like my mind. Very fast and swift. I do really salute to the Smiths who crafted this beast. Must have gadget.	5
Here's the benchmark, op6t just defeated them all except the asus ROG Phone a gaming phone.	5
Awesome product.. value for money..Ratings 5/5 for Camera, battery, display, processor..Only missing notification light..	5
Must buy ridiculously fast	5
This phone is superb. The bottom firing speakers are a bit soft to my liking but it's pretty decent. I'd suggest you guys go for the 8GB model as the phone was using 3.1 GB ram right out of the box but overall, an excellent phone. You can't go wrong with this. ;)	5
It's fantastic product thank you one plus for such an amazing mobile and also thank you for Amazon for delivery it like in lighting speed less than an 24 hours from I placed an order..	5
A very good smartphone	5
Amazing product	5
Bought it for my friend.After using it for 2 to 3 hrs..I would became mad to buy this.Such an wonderful camera.Install Google Camera.. For awesome clearity and crispy pics with nature lightings.No heating issues faced till nowLittle wytBut not look like bulky.Overall awesome mobile with higher end processor.Go for it.	5
Superb phone with awesome look and performance...!!!I'm using 3T before changed to 6T ...my 2 days experience is awesome ....sound and video quality is good....!!! Battery lifetime is good lasting long...!!!Thank you oneplus :-)	5
The speed and the heavy operational performance is flawless.but I felt battery is starting to drain a bit faster then one plus 5	4
Amazing phone with brilliant camera clarity and feature specially night scape mode. Good battery life. Mirror black is simply awesome..	5
As always one plus is firzt in my wish list,both design and performance only drawback i feel is mobile size and weight,other than that OP 6T is a perfect mobile	5
Amazing ! As always OnePlus rocks !!	5
Nice phone	5
Including the discount I got OP6t at 34.5k. I have been using this phone heavily  for 3days now. Worth mentioning the Oxygen OS is one of the best in market and has the capability to challenge the IOS. Its a bliss to play games in OP 6t.  Camera is good and specially the nightscape mode.Charging is very fast with the dash charger. Fingerprint and face unlock is swift. This is a kind of phone you can easily recommend to someone.But they could have easily added the headphone jack.Cheers to one plus. They should keep up the good work.	5
Product is really good & worth buying.	5
Superb phone, finger print sencor is awesome,really the flagship killer..	4
Quick delivery...sensitive touch..On screen fingerprint sensor is slower than the normal one..the difference can be felt	5
I like the phone very much. Messages option is very nice. Sending all notifications under one category. But it would be better you should have provided FM(Radio) default app also. Also all the pics if displayed at one place will be easier. Now we have to go to collections and search if we require any pic that was sent from friends.I didn't understand how the second camera works. If there is no option of changing camera, what is the use of giving 2 cameras backside?	4
I purchased it on 1 Nov 18  & now it's 4th Nov. Till now it's working fine but when play music loud, it's getting heated.	3
Best phone ever !!!! Strongly recommend. No issues faced regarding on-screen fingerprint scanner.	5

One plus 6T is just awesome, worth spending money and fastest delivery by Amazon within 24 hours. This is One of the fastest mobile I have ever seen.Very much impressed with On-Screen fingerprint sensor, water drop notch and most importantly the night mode camera. Please go for it, if you are looking for a good and fastest phone.Pros :1. Speed is simply amazing with Snapdragon processor. Even if I try to load a high end games2. The camera quality is good with night mode.3. The subtle curve gives you a premium look for the phone.4. OnScreen fingerprint sensor and face unlock is simply amazing.5. Used it for 2 days and the battery backup is good. It's giving you 1day of life with heavy usage.Dash charger will charge your phone in half an hour.Cons:1. There is no 3.5mm jack but one plus have given you with the connector to use headphones2. There is no much difference between one plus 6 and 6T. Except one or two features.	5
Everything is amazing...can't really complain about anything.#Pros:+Display: you get extra real estate than OP6...which is great.+Battery: Bigger and better+Camera: Definitely improved front shooter+In display fp scanner: To be honest, I really liked the older one...but this is also good...I mean so far loving it. Speed is also good and the face unlock works like a charm.+Latest and greatest processors+Buttons are clicky.+WiFi connectivity is good.+Loads of customizations in Oxygen OS.+Ambient display is good...+Gestures are really really amazing (Best thing)#Cons:-No 3.5mm jack of course  (already missing it)-No notification LED-Two speaker grills but only one speaker...other one just holds microphone (No strereo but it's way loud)And I accidentally cover it with hand...it's annoying.	5
Black spot detected on the bottom left of the screen.Returning the product.Highly Disappoint with #oneplus6T	1
Oneplus 6T's performance is awesome and fingerprint sensor works well. water drop notch is really good.	5
Best mobile phone.i love it	5
Hey ONE PLUS COMMUNITY , can you give better than this.	5
Contender for phone of the year?Terrific battery, great camera, low light or otherwise. Display looks classy. Dew drop notch, very unobtrusive. No heating issues on high intensity games either.3.5 mm Jack missing which is well known by now, but made my peace with it (comes with a converter). Slighty longer response to fingerprint unlock, barely noticeable. But the face unlock as very fast and makes up for it.Unless you have the budget for the S9 Plus, go for this. Hands down, best premium phone I've used in the last few years.	5
Phone was excellent...super fast new finger lock also fast n it's animation looking so beautiful... delivery also on time	5
You've probably watched various reviews on YouTube so I'll cut to the chase.If you want a very fast and smooth OS experience, no lag, timely software updates along with the premium feel, just go for it.Fingerprint Scanner : Sometimes it's crazy fast, sometimes it takes time, you get used to it. After using indisplay fingerprint scanner, you'll forget about rear mounted ones.Notch : This looks extremely good compared to oneplus 6Camera : Both Cameras nowhere close to my S9+. But easily beats a number of other smartphones.Storage : you get around 115gb freeRam: 6gb is more than enough. 4000 inr for extra 2gb is not worth it.Face Unlock : Probably The Fastest Out There.Gaming : Games load faster than ever.A lot Faster Than S9+Display : Display is crisp and clear with FHD+ resolution. But since i have been using S9+ also so i can clearly see difference between QHD and FHD display. Brightness is less compared to S9+. HDR 4K videos are supported in 6TCharging : 1 hour 15 minutes for full charge ( Can Vary Depending On How and When You Plug In)OS :  Android 9 With November Security PatchSpeakers : Same As 5T,6. Nothing New HereAudio Jack : Gone. Using Dongle Is Not Everyone's Cup Of Tea. But Those Prebooked Will Get Type C Earphones. So no worries here.Heavier Than 5T,6 due to increased battery size.Hope you find this useful for your purchaseNote : Don't Compare This To Trash Phones Like Poco , Zenfone etc.	5
Switching over from my Iphone 8 to Oneplus 6t.1 - SpeedYes, Oneplus claims the truth that you're going to "Unlock Speed" with this one. The face unlock and brand new in display fingerprint in this phone is insanely fast.2- HardwareThe built quality of the phone gives you a very premium feel, glass back , amazing curved design, oled screen and teardrop notch can give a bummer to any other premium smartphone in the market.3- ProcessorDamn, I love this one, Snapdragon 845 and 8GB of RAM makes it one of the fastest phones in the world right now, get ready for an amazing never lagging gaming experience and user interface.4- SoftwareAndriod 9, Pie and Oxygen OS makes the interface of the phone look beautiful, and it looks beautiful to me as I've been using apple for past two years with same interface. Gestures, customizations and various other oxygen os features give you a very good in-phone experience.5- CameraAmazing for low light photography, I haven't test the camera much, would edit my review after testing it for sometime.CONS1- It would be great if Oneplus launches phones with IP water resistant certificate and Wireless Charging from next time.2- Include the Type C bullet earphones inside the box itself. They're out of stock on amazon.	5
When compared to other phones, it is excellent at this price range.	4
Powerful performance, value for money	5
Love the display	5
From LCD to this superb AMOLED display was the first thing that struck me while switching from previous budget phones to this device. The tech specs didn't bother me much since the previous phones I've used was far below this. The camera did surprise me but didn't quite meet the hype. The night scape feature was a let down. From 3 days usage it deserve a 5 star rating.	5
Good mobile!!!!Excellent....nightscape mode is wellBattery backup good	5
Superbbbb phone , nice display , unlock the speed , camera excellent , increased space , worth the money ,overall awesome..........,	5
Excellent mobile with nice camera and new fingerprint scanner.Notch display is awesome.Pros - Phone's weight,Notification light missing	5
OMG I can't believe my eyes..... Its Incredibly awesome phone. The midnight black is Looking so finished and premium in hand. Amazing features. I feel like I developed the phone. Everything is customisable. Only con is that the headphone jack. But it doesn't matter for me. Overall its still a value for money FLAGSHIP KILLER.	5
Great	5
Simply superb.Camera, display, battery all will fulfil your regular expectationsNot need to look for second one at least for 1 year.Over and above all these stock like android experience is the best feature of One Plus One.	5
Absolutely amazing phone!!!	5
Yes the product met my expectations. Battery backup is good. Excellent camera picture quality. Finger print sensor is amazing. It's worth for money.	4
Camera work comparatively compromising with iphones else best flagship phone yet	4
I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.	1
Good product.amazing experience	4
Being an iPhone user this jump was a bit apprehensive at first, but when I received this device and started using it, I simply fell in love with it. I'd choose OnePlus over apple anytime. Sorry apple	5
I ordered the phone on 1st November 2018. Got it delivered on the same day itselfTremendous improvement by Oneplus in terms of Camera Quality. The night mode photos are brilliant.The inDisplay finger print sensor is fast and accurateThe notch in beautifully designed and will make you likeeeee the phone even more	5
Best phone ever, superb speed, in display fingerprint is the best 	5
Such a nice phone excellent build quality superb performance better view angle classic group comfortable so smooth never settle satisfied with phone	5
What an amazing phone.  I have used iphone for years but the experience of this phone is simply awesome.What i loved :1) Speed2) Design3) OS4) Usability5) Brilliant CameraI think for 44k it is a steal as compared with Iphone XS Max.	5
Battery sucks.. 6 was much better than 6T hands down. I feel most of the reviews are paid reviews. I have been a proud owner of oneplus products but i am really disappointed in 6t. The battery won't last for a day even with minimal usage.	1
The flash	5
Speaker is not working, not happy with the product. I have placed request for replacement but haven't received any confirmation from Amazon yet. Very disappointed.	1
Wow just a awesome mobile love it too too good its awesome.... thanks one plus team	5
Mobile is too good , but product i received faulty , on 2 nd day I connected to charging by keeping g switch off and change sim card . it cant switched on .  I placed immediately replacement order and Amazon take it properly. Thanks Amazon. But now I cancelled and all order.	3
Happy with the performance!	5
Extremely fast but lacks in the camera department	4
Bought phone on 2nd november. Very good phone.  Value for money. Night mode photography is just awsome. Need to give selfie flash. overall very good phone. Speed is really good.	4
Simply awesome, cannot go anything wrong with OnePlus, premium look and user experience is top class of the likes of flagship Sony or flagship Samsung,Don't expect such flagship experience from cheap models like realme or redmi	5
When will I get type C bullet headset and when should I add that gift card ?	5
Excellent product. Fast delivery service.	5
Its very good phone. Its perfectly fit to its cost.	4
Awesome mobile..nice camera and battery back up.very fast processors. A good deal within this budget	5
Smooth and Sexy... Just awesome	5
I bought it for my friend and got 1k  amazon pay balance..!   	5
Excellent Mobile deleverd on time	5
Loving it, Amazon courier service is also awesome, they delivered the phone withing 10 hours. Just awesome, 5 stars...	5
I love this phone supper smooth...and photos are perfect	5
It's an excellent product	5
Powerful performance. Improved camera and battery. I love it! It got delivered within 48 hrs!	5
Super fast Super cool phone. In display fingerprint scanner is so futuristic. Its time to embrace technology - time to use Bluetooth headphones & goodbye 3.5mm jack.	5
Awesome	5
Excellent phone from one plus	5
Overall Nice phone with good battery,repsonsive fingerprint sensor & Nice camera.100% worth for the money you spend	5
Fingerprint detection is slow and there is a small air bubble traped under the screen guard	4
Simply awesome.... performance packed phone.. battery backup is very good compared OnePlus 6...fingerprint on screen works flawlessly..	5
No more doubt this device will deserve 5 star. But yesterday only I received the delivery. While charging and playing the games it will reching up 44 degree Celsius. Present I am having both op5 and op 6t op 5 is very even charging or playing game it will not crossed the 34 degree Celsius.But 6t is heating rapidly. Normal time it will in 33 c like only.	4
Phone functions are nice. Battery performance is not lasting good. Battery is dying very rapidly. I am changing full charge twice in 24hrs still battery is getting down to 19%. Most funny part is that I am hardly using my phone. This is very depressing after paying such a big amount (hard earned money) of Rs. 38000/- and battery performance is so much poor.Spoken to the Amazon technical support for this. They have done some online test through some app and get to know that something is wrong with this phone battery and told me for the "BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE" on Monday 5th November 2018. I have received my phone on 2nd Nov and spoken to Amazon technical support engineer on 3rd Nov. Although I haven't received any email / SMS from Amazon yet. I can trust them on there words and will receive brand NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE on 5th November itself.	2
Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone	5
Those who were eagerly waiting for this to arrive, rest assured you won't be disappointed at all.Indeed another flagship killer from one plus :)Smother and faster as compared to previous versions. Battery easily lasted for 12 hours with heavy usage.	5
Very fast device never experienced this type of speed	5
OnePlus 6t is perfect.Delivered within 24 hours of placing order.	5
It's beyond amazing....I m happy with my decision and also by this product	5
Awesome phone it is	5
No doubt the best as always.	5
Had audio issues . Asked for replacement	1
Packaging : It wasn't good,Box was wrapped with bubble wrap that's it.Delivery: It was quick as lightning,  got it within 36 hours.Product: It's a nice one by OnePlus. Superfast processing, Amazing camera, In Display finger print is also very good and responsive but sometime a bit slow. Look wise exactly as Oneplus 6 n the glass finish on back gives a premium touch to it.Using it for last 2 days overall I am quite happy with it.	5
The best phone in the market. Don't think twice. Just go for it.	5
Absolutely stunned by the optic amoled touchscreen. The night mode and adaptive brightness is amazing. Sound quality is better as compared to earlier one plus series. The new striking feature finger print sensor and that too in built , one plus just nailed it !Tried my hand first time on one plus smartphones and highly impressed with it.	5
Switched from one plus x(A medium size phone) to one plus 6t.Overall in my family there is a lot of varieties of phones such as Iphone 7 plus,Redmi note 5 pro, Samsung Galaxy s8.But before this I was using one plus x because of of it's compact size and still some respectable speed.If you comapare  op 6t with a mid range device you would find out some really good differences.Here are some of my extra features that nobody gonna tell you.* Gaming mode- I loved it.*It's UI is super fast you can't see any lag there*Gesture mode is nice.* Switching of apps is very fast and quick* Nightscape mode is somewhat good rather than normal shot* There is studio lighting in front camera while doing the flash on which gives you a warmer photo.*Battery is larger than the op6 and full charging(10-100%) takes around 55 minutes.* I have played 12 full games of pubg and still battery was 17%Overall verdict:If you are planning nto buy a phone that can live in the market for 2.5-3 years and you need a flagship ..this is the phone.People will tell you buy the asuz Zenfone 5z or the Poco but trust me ..You will love the op6t display cause it's amoled	5
A good package all together. It's a big upgrade for me from a basic smartphone. still exploring many features. Image clarity is good. Battery lasted for a day with mix usage of calls, WhatsApp,YouTube, FB, Insta, Google lens, photo, Google maps (8AM to 11PM with 31% and still going).	5
Been using it for past 2 days. Everything's great so far, especially the user experience and speed. In display finger print scanner is a bit slow or takes time to recognize. One won't even feel there's a notch and almost all screen is really cool. One thing that's not flagship grade will be the camera but it does a decent job.	5
Awesome product love it 	5
The phone is really awesome and battery backup is just too good... Battery charging is v fast. Amazon delivery was too fast overall happy and excited about the oneplus6t	5
Did not get a physical bill device is good	1
Amazing speed and classy looks. OnePlus has maintained their class with 6t. The only thing I miss is the lead notification light but for achieving this screen to body ratio I think it's acceptable.	5
It's just awesoommeeee , brilliant phone , nice camera , oxygen os is also very good . It's the beasttt ...	5
Very good mobile and delivery is on time.	5
Best investment one can ever make for buying a phone. The sheer firepower it gives is amazing. If you are here for best user experience, then this is the ONE for you.	5
This is absolute beast of a phone. Love every aspects of it. I find no issues with the headphone jacks and notification led. You need to get a little used to it. The speed is phenomenal. All in one, this phone is absolute love.	5
Everything of dis phone is more then perfect for its price range be it camera, battery life, display ,OS. YES Its the true King of speed it just breezes through everyday tasks nd some heavy media usage.	5
Delivery was very fast...it took around 1.5 days...the package was intact no problems what's so ever	5
As perfect as a phone can be...and at that too at this price??? The little thank you note from Peter Lau..was a very nice touch. There's nothing to complain about as of now.	5
Great product and service by Amazon	5
Don't buy anyone this product because both sim not 4g, no notification light, extra large display, no battery backup, I want sell my one plus 6t	1
Excellent phone. I am very happy with it.	5
It is the greatest phone ever! Good hardware combined with excellent software.6T ticks all the boxes of the modern day flagships, plus it has in-display fingerprint which is surprisingly fast and more convenient than the one mounted on the back.It has improved battery backup, large storage options at relatively same price, excellent memory management and the best UI you will find on a phone.The Oxygen OS gives you the latest offerings from Android and is very responsive and very pleasing just to look at! It gives you a lot of customisation options to make your phone feel more personal.The only small setback is an average camera. But don't worry, it's pretty good and can do a great job capturing images and won't disappoint you.This is the best buy for 30-40k budget segment and you won't regret buying it.I am very happy with this phone. Oneplus!	5
excellent	4
Was waiting for this from the day it was announced..Finally ordered it on 1st Nov and got it exactly after 24hrs...kudos to Amazon's superb delivery..Talking about the phone, been using it from past 3days now, here are some key points :*Not a single lag till now-superfast interface*Clear and nice photos -esp. Night mode works better*Large display with a small notch, trust me once you have it you won't get annoyed, don't listen to negative reviews*Cool gestures*Gaming experience*No heating problems, whatsoever*Dash charging- battery performance is also good!And what not, in short, I would say whatever the company is advertising it's true in reality.It's my first Oneplus phone and I'm loving it !PS: Although Mirror black variant is Beautiful but still I would prefer to go for Midnight black variant.. that was out of stock when I ordered hence I got mirror black, I love it but that's the issue I live in fear of it getting dropped and smashed.	5
Awesome phone but fingerprint sensor is a bit slowBest to buy in this price segment nowSlightly thicker and heavier than OnePlus 6	4
After using it for 2 days.. I can say that this phone really surpassed my expectations.. Great battery life is the most impressive thing for me..	5
every thing is so perfect with phone that I fall in love with phone. However screen finger sensor's success rate is very low. It is less than 30 %.	5
No Headphone, No Cashback provided.	1
Good	3
Great phone!!!!!Awesome UI(oxygen OS)Performance	5
One word to say its awesome.	5
Very good in performance..snappier enough for everyday use..camera is really good..lack of 3.5mm head phone jack could be an issue for some users..but since the battery life is really good, it is not causing any problem for me. The battery lasts for one complete day easily.	5
Very nice mobile	5
Overall it's a masterpiece..	5
Simply amazing phone...	5
Buying experienceBad buying experience at 12:00 AM with ICICI cash back, 16 transactions (24hr retry).Amazon says its not their problem. Bank it's not their problem. Finally, I got fooled. I had to buy for the full amount on Nov 2nd.Pros:SP845 processor,AMOLED Display,Good for GamingDash charging, in-display fingerprint sensor, 380ppi screen.Camera low light experience is good.Cons:Camera Portrait is so artificial.Noisy speaker - feels like a cheap Chinese phone speaker.The fingerprint sensor is not so fast as claimed, can't switch off the glowing animations.Battery drains to 0 with 5hour Intense gaming.In 8GB RAM only 2.5GB available ?? ~5.5 GB for system use ???	3
The phone is great and camera is great	5
Amazing Mobile.  Superb Performance.  Battery, Camera quality are very efficient.	5

It's really awesome phone, very fast, and camera even take unbelievable picture in dark also , I m not expecting that it will take pic like this in dark night but when I get I test that first.It is Handy phone and light weight with amazing features.I think u can go for that it's better than iPhone in camera quality in deam light.Easy to use	5
Great battery life....superb camera....no headphones jack..no memory card..	5
The design is good, fast processor, great camera and storage , can resist few drops of water but not recommended for swimming . Nice finger print sensor concept but not a fan of notch. Price has to be reviewed.	5
No doubts. The best smartphone of this Era. In regards of performance and speed you need.	5
I really loved it!!!Good specs.Good performance.Faster speed.Better camera quality and very good night photography.Good battery life.No 3.5mm jack but no problem there is a Type-C to 3.5mm jack connector within the boxOverall it's a best smartphone.	5
Good battery with high performance, very speedy interface, good alternative for iphone	5
The Phone looks Awesome.. The front bezelless screen is Amazing....Indiaplay fingerprint is the main  highlight which looks pretty amazing but still needs  to improvised to respond quickly...Over all experience is Great...I am happy Buying this Device	5

One day delivery on time.	5
Very fast operation.Canera's quality is best... Even better than top end phones than today's market.Quality speaker output.Lots of advance features... Go for it n experience it yourself.	5
Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor. It is very sensible I must say unlike the back one. I need to put my finger in proper way otherwise I won't be able to unlock my phone.	4
I just upgraded from op6 .. and the reason is battery... Very good battery life here in op 6t and mobile works without any lag...	5
Very good for the price. I'm someone who usually buys the best best flagship available, however this time due to budget concerns I settled on the OnePlus 6T. Camera isn't great, but for this price it's a worthy tradeoff. Love the speed of the device and will be sure to buy only OnePlus phones in the future.By far the best thing about the device is the speed with which it charges. I never have to worry about low battery again.	5
Awesome phone... instant delivery .... one of the best phone till date	5
Overall perfect android phone..	4
Best phone in the market !!!	5
One of the best smartphones I have used... The snappiest Android device out there	5
Super faster better in that price, camera was some issue plz update it	5
Awesome phone with great performance, nice camera features and picture quality, good battery backup and super cool fingerprint sensor.	5
Great phone.....worth for money.	5
It's an amazing phone, super fast, charges in 1 hour and it lasts all day. Loved the camera and the night mode is really good. Gaming experience is really amazing. Face unlock is really fast, and I really liked the onscreen finger print scanner. It's accurate and I do not have any problem with it. I don't really miss the headphone jack as you get the adapter. I also find the phone back cover that they provide quite good. It's an amazing phone experience, you can go for it.	5
I bought this phone for larger screen, performance is very good no lag at all. Photos with nightscape looks like oil painting which needs a fix.	5
Excellent product	5
Everything designed very wellespecially nightscape is awesome..functioning also very well..Worth it..	5
Best phone like cameras, tich, fastest	5
Excellent mobile with excellent features worthy one to purchase ,	5
Awesome product from one plus.	5
Great first impression	5
Exllecent phone with all functions........	5
This is the beast ,very very much awesome and it's design and the whole body why one thing whole phone is awesome... Also so fast delivery... I got it in 2 days with my watch which I order 1 day later after phone but I got both together... I got watch within 24 hours... So fast man...And this phone is beauty.. I recommend it to you...	5
Excellent phone...At this price bracket and launch offers like exchange, cash back, card offers and Jio this is great deal...Pros :* Inphone fingerprint* 6.41 display* Stylish and premium looks* Android 9* Great CameraCons :Not really cons but can be improved though these are personal suggestion...* Brightness is little bit on a lesser side if I compare it with 5T though this is Amoled* Video and Audio Sound is also not in line with 5T which got bigger and better soundThat's it folks!!!!	4
Arrived before time I m so excited about the 6t.Such a lovely phone	5
Excellent phone. Its a beast worth the price.Pros: Good AMOLED Screen, design, clean Oxygen OS running Android Pie, Navigation Gestures, Camera UI improvements, more screen to body ratio, notch looks classy, On display finger print scanner is fast.Cons: No wireless charging, no headphone jack, no IP Rating, Same camera setup at OP6.Despite the Cons. This phone is a must buy for those who wanna have the value for money and yet get best specs instead. One can use a bluetooth wireless headphones and extra covering to tide over jack issues or IP rating. The specs, the look and feel of the phone with body to screen aspect ratio with the water drop notch and one screen finger print scanner in this range make it a flagship killer phone.A premium device.	5
Super	5
Superb! Camera is good, speed is amazing, full view screen, battery is good and lasts a day.	5
Phone as per the description mentioned on the page.Oxygen OS performs pretty well .No lags will running any application	5
Fantabulous	5
After using OnePlus 3T, 5T and OP6, OP6T is as expected. Great Product. Camera is better than OP6 even though having same camera as OP6	5
Worth it	5
Speed is superb... Smooth like makkan	5

Amazing phone... Picture quality.. fast phone. That phone fullfil my all requirements.. love u oneplus.	5
Display	5
OnePlus 6t is great with its bigger battery.	5
The OnePlus 6T  is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.......Great battery lifeFluid performanceTop-end designImpressive rear camera.......	5
Superb phone in every respect rating 5/5 ,onscreen finger touch sensor great,fast face unlocking,long lasting battery,camera quality superb	5
The OnePlus 6T is superbly great, well crafted, extremely powerful, and fully capable of doing what most people want their phones to do beyond imagination. When compared to other phones at its own price level, the camera performance on the OnePlus 6T is farther better than other phones. Everything is at its peak best.The beast in half of Xsmax price wd a waterdrop notch along wd edge cut superbly magnificient.Cons:Only thing is the battery could be more powerful#Thankyou Oneplus	5
Awesome	5
First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....I don't know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.Read till the last for my last suggestion1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I'm sure this is the best Offer one can get and I'm sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area9) The charging rate is good, I'm sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I've used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don't like this.11) I've used the phone with google maps "ON" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That's up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I'm not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage conditionTrust Me friends, don't waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera	3
Switched from I phone to this one, indeed this phone offers lot of features which an iOS user can't think of.UI of iOS is better however if you have budget to buy an I phone with larger memory only then go for it else this one is way better	5
Observed for 1and half day the charging stands well.. upon complete using . Camera clarity was also good..Tha major difference  was the notch it looks cool..Multiple apps usage is also very fast..Looks wer so stylish.. im happy with the oneplus easy data transfer switch.. in few minutes i could tranafer everything  and my all new Oneplus6T is ready to use.. in display fingerprint  scanner was amazing..just go a head and grab it soon with the best deals..	5
Prompt delivery as promised and quality product	5
Superb phone	5
No headphone jack! Just bigger battery and water drop notch. No camera improvement, below expectations.... Don't buy this phone just wait for oneplus7 ( hope some exiting features)... If you have oneplus 6 then don't buy it because no major ( even minor) improvement in it ( 6 is better than 6t)  and if you are not a oneplus user then also don't buy it. I was so excited about this phone but disappointed.	3
After 2-3 days of usage, product is awesome. It's time Never Settle.I have. Feedback for Amazon, there was 1000 RS Amazon pay cashback with this. But still I did not get it. Can you please check and update?	5
Don't think much just buy this. It's the best phone available in the market.	5
Nice phone, fast n smooth. Some time unable to download app. That's issue.	5
One plus is emerging as company which works on company nerd. Fast and smooth is their Moto.By each product they are delivering it and they have it with one plus 6t, great phone to have.	5
Super package	5
Best	5
I am guy who is 22 yrs old but till date I have used 18 phones.. This is my 19th phone.. previous I have been using apple for the last 3.8yrs... But unfortunately on last sunday I lost my phone on highway.. After that I was very confused which phone to buy Android or ios.. Because as we all knew that touch sensitivity of apple is always top notch n people who are using iPhone will always opt for apple.. But this time I had a different experience with One plus 6t.. It's not an amazing,good looking ohine but it can perform as well beyond limits.. It really very fast with only 6GB RAM I sure hope it will perform much better with 8GB RAM.. Build quality is top notch, design is satisfying enough for a stand alone in the crowd.. Camera n display is way better within this price tag.. And lastly but not the least you get all the features n this premium phone at only 38k for 6GB Ram n 42k for 8 GB Ram with dual sim and 128 gb internal storage... So where do apple stand infront of this phone when compared with price tag.. So please go ahead n buy this phone without any hesitation or doubt..Thank you	5
Just awesome, loving it's camera quality and battery performance...	5

Amazing experience. No mobile can  beat this mobile at this price. Ofcours they never settle.	5
Excellent	5
Features provided for the cost is way better than the current market value. The only difference between this and other high end devices is probably with camera and speakers. Performance is great and faster than most of the other flagship devices. But when compared with the current market price of the devices, it beats them all.	5

I switched my One Plus 2 to One Plus 6T after 3 long years. I got the phone by today.-Amazing Camera even in low light conditions.-DASH Charger an absolute beast. Take 1hr to charge form 10 to 90%-Battery Backup is good. 6.5 hrs in average usage.Played PUBG for 30 minutes and battery reduced from 100% to 89%. Impressive.-Display Is Really nice. Blacks are darker and yeah that notch.-In Display finger print scanner is fast. You have a choice to set between 3 animations.-3.5 to USB Type-C adapter included in the box.-Black smoke silicon case included.-Protective screen pre installed.Oh wait , The Oxygen OS. Amazing gestures , great feel and very fast.Good buy. 100% recommend.#NeverSettle.	5
What an amazing phone!This is one of the best phones I have ever used. Great camera quality and awesome battery life.	5
Super very good OnePlus	5
Yesterday, I bought Oneplus 6T - 8GB RAM - 256 GB Storage, Mobile.1. I ordered for this phone on 02 November 2018 and as assured, Amazon delivered it yesterday.  Thanks to Amazon.I have started using it.  So far, so good.2. When I charge this Mobile, the Charging Light is not glowing.Is there a Charging Light in this Mobile?OnePlus company says 'No Charging Light' in this mobile.Thumbs Down not to have this basic feature in this model.3. The printed Quick Start Guide which came with this mobile is in Red Colour Paper with Black Colour  tiny font, making it too difficult to read during night even with good tubelight.4. This mobile is available only in two black colour variants.  They should at least make it available in White colour also.5. The weight of the Charging plug is more.  I feel it may be around 175 grams.Thanks.	3
Everything thing is good	4
Amazing specs, brilliant performance especially in gaming mode....	5
Oneplus is always my first priority. 6t just feels like a jewellery in your hand. The performance is just top notch and oxygen os is so flawless that it works better then stock.  I highly recommend this. You'll never regret this purchase ever.	5
Really a good phoneNight mode is awesome	5
Yes on time delivery.	5
Another masterpiece from Oneplus... Just loved it the only draw back is the in display fingerprint is a bit slow as we are used only to the external ones, which are damn faster in previous Oneplus phones... Display is crisp but not bright enough when compared to the Oneplus 5t that's due to the Android pie update, the Battery is one of the best till I've used in all my phones. its a beast in its own class .... loving the phone till now	5
Impeccable Gaming performance.40 minute charge with full day use.Water drop display gives an amazing look.Camera night mode was good.In-Display Fingerprint quite good.Face unlock was just superb than any other smartphone in the market.OnePlus kicked  a** once again.	5
I watched 10-20 review videos before buying but only after using this phone I understood actual meaning of 6 gb RAM ! Speed is something which is USP of this product and I must say phone has awesome speed of opening apps and regular  running. Must buy ! See...we all have EMI and credit options but if you actually need a phone then I will suggest you must go for it !!!	5
Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is  absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered.	5
At first I was very excited to purchase this phone coz everyone was talking about it how good it is, how fast it is. Moreover I was also very eager to own this phone. I placed the order and thanks to Amazon timely delivery, I got this product the next day. I've been using this phone from last 2 days and lemme tell you guys, the battery sucks and the finger lock and face unlock features are not fast enough as they are advertised. I don't even play heavy games on my phone apart from candy crush but the battery hardly last for half a day which quite frankly sucks as it has a larger battery of 3700 MAH. Feeling really disappointed and hoping that one plus will fix these problems in thr next update.Apart from that, the phone speed is good and the apps are working just great. I guess after spending 38K, I feel cheated now.	2
This is my first experience with one plus. Good camera, better performance, good screen quality but phone little bit heavy. Go for it.	5
Over all good as migrating from iPhone to Android feeling good, no more words but bit battery issues I think.Worth moving from ios but not from any latest android devices.Finger sensor is quite slow than expected, gaming is awesome. Pubg n asphalt ran smoothly.Disappointed as in USA many accessories were given in box but as in India only one carbon case and price 5k higher than USA.	4
The fluidic Operating System is working amazingly.Best phone to have. Super-cool on screen unlock, best screen and amazing camera with really long battery backup. Best of the OnePlus.Oneplus 6 users you just really do not need to upgrade as Oneplus is providing updates in the camera and UI as same as Oneplus 6T.Old OnePlus phones users you really need to unlock the speed with 6 or 6T	5
ONE WORD REVIEW......AWWEESSOOOMMMEEEEE..... BRILLIANT DISPLAY SUPER FAST OXYGEN OS GOOD CAMERA IN DISPLAY FINGERPRINT IS QUITE RESPONSIVE FACE UNLOCK IS SNAPPY OVERALL GREAT BANG FOR THE BUCK!!!!!!!!BUY ITAWESOME JOB ONEPLUS AND THANKS AMAZON FOR SUPER FAST DELIVERY...!!!	5
One hell of a product, does beat iPhone X.Unbeatebly faster than any previous one plus.	5
There have been lots of talks about this phone and it has been really interesting. I come from Apple ecosystem and I am not a big fan of Android but I gotta say the OnePlus 6T didn't let me down a bit. Especially because of the OxygenOS. It's magical. Here are some reviews about the features.The fingerprint sensor: okay so this gotta come first right? Personally I was not so sure about this feature. I mean it looked cool and all but I was confused whether it'll be worth or not and believe me it is. It's hardly a few milliseconds slower than the traditional scanner and to be honest that doesn't matter at all. It's way much more convenient than a rear fingerprint scanner. It's quick and it looks really good. I've tried it many times and it has only failed to register my finger once when I had some oil on it. Otherwise it's always perfect.Display: the display is vivid and beautiful. Nothing much to say but the notch is really nice.Camera: the cameras are great. I had expected an upgrade in this department but they still take some great photos. I have added one here for sample. It's just beautiful.Battery: oh I love the battery backup. It's amazing. It easily lasts for a day and half. And dash charge is magical. The phone is charged before you even know it.Hardware and software: the hardware is so premium. This is what differentiates this phone and the cheap stupid Pocophone. This looks and feels so premium. There is a very underrated feature about this phone actually. OnePlus had said that they have improved the antenna of this phone and it really works great. I mean places where other people are not able to load Instagram on the same network, I can easily play PUBG at full hd graphics without lag and also watch YouTube videos in 1080p. This is maybe the most important feature of this phone. And talking about gaming this phone runs games smoothly as expected and there are never any lags anywhere in any app. Coming to the software OxygenOS is great. I daresay it's better than stock Android too. It has so many little things in it. It's all these little things that make it so interesting and user friendly. I am literally in love with it.Lastly the headphone jack. Yeah it's not there and I am not a huge fan of that but it's really not as big of a deal as people are making it sound. They are just ranting about it like crybabies. Get over it. It's not there but it doesn't suck that much. You just don't get to listen to music while you're charging if you still use the wired headphones and this phone charges real quick. So although it's a downside it's not really a big deal. I mean I am not gonna hate a phone just because it doesn't have a headphone jack. I wish the dumb MI fans will understand it someday too.So if you're confused in any way believe me this phone will never let you down.	5
Awesome phone.fluid touch..fan since OnePlus one.	5
This Phone is such a darling ! It is really very smart.. I like how we can open it just by saying ok Google from a good distance. Speed is quite fast.. notch is looking good.. I found it a bit heavier than previous models. Processing is awesome with nice camera and great visual quality of screen charging is super fast same like 6 and 5t models.. phone worth considering and best in quality as compared to others! Go for it you won't regret	5
Awesome product and working awesome till date happy to be proud owner of OnePlus from the OnePlus 1...This phone seems to be working as advertised without any lag and really happy with it	5
Mobile king... Never settle...	5
Amazing phone, just feels good.Done the ma+h, price isn't everything.You get what you pay for. :)Excellent battery,Great screen,Amazing performance,Smoooth OS,Great camera,Surprisingly decent audio,Cool screen unlock and ridiculously fast face unlock.The phone is worth every penny spent.	5
Performance, display quality, camera quality are excellent.Fingerprint censor can be better.Battery lasts entire day.It takes 1 hr 15 mins for 0-100% charged.Missing 3.5 jack problem is adjustable with adapter provided with the handset. Waiting for the type-c bullet headphone.Phone does not look premium with the back cover provided with handset. Should include Sandstone/Karbon type back cover with [1+] logo.Overall very good.	4
Awesome phone as usual. In-display Fingerprint works fine but needs improvement. I used this phone for one day completely and as of now it is too good. Way to goo..	5
Awesome phone	5
The in-display fingerprint sensor is very bad. It is slow and many times it takes multiple attempts to scan the finger. This phone is big disappointment. I would not recommend this phone at all.They didn't give headphone jack which is okay as they were giving free bullets V2 for those who pre-booked the phone. But they should atleast have given IP rating as IP gives peace of mind and stereo speaker should have been there instead of dummy holes at bottom. Needless to say that Oneplus phones have good software and this one is no exception. This has good software which is fast and fluid. My point is that don't buy this phone for fingerprint sensor. If you are having other OnePlus phone then you should hold for next OnePlus phone.	1
The OnePlus 6T is a truly great phone no matter what the price, but at half the cost of an iPhone XS with a cutting-edge in display fingerprint sensor this is the bargain buy of the year. Everybody is complaing about in-display fingerprint scanner is slow but trust me its very very very fast, phone gets unlocked as soon as your finger touches the screen and more accurate than other phones, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that cutting-edge technology doesnt have to cost the Earth, bringing an in-display fingerprint scanner and a tiny notch for just 37K. The gorgeous, crisp and colourful OLED display is a smidgen bigger at 6.41in, with a smaller chin at the bottom is simply amazing, coming to camera the new nightscape low light mode does a good job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is also pretty good Portrait mode works as advertised, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is good and when you use the fingerprint sensor the night mode for the display is disabled temporarily and then fades back in once youve unlocked the phone. The phone comes with a screen protector already on it. the single bottom-firing speaker is loud and has a relatively large amount of bass for the phone, but is easily blocked while playing a game. OnePluss alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and is still brilliant. OnePlus phones have always been good for the money, offering top specifications in well-built devices, but not pushing the boundaries of whats possible. Thats changed for the OnePlus 6T. It is pushing whats possible with the popular all-screen design using a tiny, attractive teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and its a better phone for it. But it is the introduction of a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, and making it work really well for as little as half the price of an iPhone XS, that is most impressive. theres no wireless charging, it doesnt have any of the fancy 3D face systems of some and it looks a little plain, but everything else is top notch. Even the software experience is excellent.Pros:- Good battery life, great screen, excellent performance, dual-sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5, great software, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, affordable price relative to premium phones, last but not least Blazing fast softwareCons:- No notification light, glass back but no wireless charging, no expandable storage.Overall phone is excellent and it really delivers it's tagline Never Settle.Being a Amazon Prime Member Still Delivery Was Slow And Packing Is Very Poor.....	5
My first one plus device and it turned out to be just amazing.  Even in low light camera gives best outcome .	5
gorgeous	5
Spent a few days with the phone now and I like it so far. The screen is awesome and the notch is not that bad. The phone feels fast and responsive and oxygen os is pretty good in my opinion. The camera is decent although I would have loved a different secondary lens like a wide angle one. Battery lasts me a full day easily and still has 30% charge remaining by the end. There are a few minor compromises but they dont matter to me personally so I have nothing to complain but i'll still list them out. They say its water resistant but it has no IP certification so I don't know exactly how water resistant it is. No headphone jack but I already used bluetooth headphones even when my phone had a headphone jack so not missing it at all. No wireless charging but I dont use that either so doesn't matter to me. Lastly to me the phone is a looker, I love its looks and seamless design.So at the end for me personally I am getting everything I wanted out of a phone for 20k less than flagship prices so I am happy.	5
Best phone	5
Good phone working very fast and night mood is awesome look is very good	5
This is what a smart Generation Smartphone is called The ONEPLUS 6T.Just buy this one you will definitely forget your apple.	5
Worth every penny you spend on it.Got it on the very first day and still can't get enough of it.	5
One of the best android phones in the market right now	5
OnePlus cooked up a nice phone, enjoying faster perofmance, quality is too good. Overall is good as of now. And Amazon delivery was good and nice packaging.	5
Really like the product. There are very minute changes between the 6 and 6T. If you have the 6 then this product isn't a big upgrade however if you are planning to buy this phone as an upgrade from say the 5 then yes it surely is a steal deal. The in screen finger sensor is rather slow but the face unlock compensates this. I personally use only Bluetooth but users may find the headphone jack not being there as an inconvenience. The connector that's been provided works wonders and if you look at it in a better way Bluetooth headphones have now become cheaper in today's world. Over all I would say 4.5 as the inscreen sensor is a little slow but I'm sure they would work on this feature soon.	4
Superb Phone	5
One of the best Android phone in market,if you want to get a premium phone with all necessary requirements,you should go for OnePlus 6T.First time I bought a phone worth 38k and the money worth it. The phone look is so aesthetic, completely wow and the water drop notch,may be you can find that in Vivo or Oppo as well,but I can tell you,you will find this better,a compact look.Joining the OnePlus Community is one of the best decision you can take,and I believe from Next OnePlus Flagships,the price will go higher,so unlock the speed and experience the best now.Things that I loved about it-Phone PerformancePhone look-Sleek and HandyDash chargeStorageA great DisplayWatching HD videos is a privilege in itPortrait mode rear and front bothGood packagingAlert sliderVideo QualityThings that can be improvised-Night mode camera optimization,it is making the picture litte whitish.Selfie in low light and front flash.Indisplay firgerprint sensor is little slow.No sensor light in front,hard to find whether it's charging or not.	5
Worth every penny. Awesome camera. Vivid display. Eye-catching water drop notch. Blazingly fast. Go for midnight black, looks premium. Battery life is 4.5/5. Dash charger is like vanilla topping. Go for it guys.	5
Fully stratified with OnePlus 6t...Even though poco f1 is at 21k..I just bought OnePlus..Worth for the money paid..OnePlus always far ahead from competition..Good battery and improved camera..screen is top range..Overall I would strongly recommend..Thanks OP for your uncompromising quality products...	5
Awesome configuration, performance, design and user experience.Everything about this phone is perfect. Value for money with best configuration in market. Boys and girls "Never Settle". .	5
Worth every pennyCamera changes, battery backup, processing speed - multitasking, inscreen fingerprint even better oneplus	5
I have been using the device and it's super snappy... The night mode in camera does a decent job since some photos were not as good as the others clicked in the night mode. The onscreen fingerprint sensor is ok. Not as fast as the physical one. Overall it's a superb product. Any who doesn't have OP6 and planning to buy a mobile should definitely consider this one.	5
Pubg is not compatible with bullets wireless so pay caution if you plan to buy those. The stock camera app has shutter delay problem which i hope will be fixed in updates.This phone has a great display. Awesome viewing angles. The ui is smooth and even the silicone case provided is of good quality. The first day launch discounts were great. Thanks amazon	5
As mentioned in the subjects is no doubt a masterpiece product... but just a suggestion don't go for the exchange offer!!! Reason  being the delivery guy drops in at 8am in the morning and does not wait cause he is in a hurry I needed to check the product wasn't even ready to handover my phone because it had all the data ...lost most of it thanks to the delivery boy so had a very bad experience before even getting my new 6t phone	3
Not a great performer. Tried to teturn this product and found from Amazon that they dont accept return as product is not defective or damaged. Ideally, return policy mentiones that you can return phone without any issues too, so unable to understand why are they not accepting return.	2
The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.CONS (Ranked) -1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.PROS (Ranked) -1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.5. Great screen.6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY	5
awesome all rounder mobile	4
 	5
phone is awesome no doubt very fast and quality is best... but delivery is not good i have an emergency for product but no costomer support at all.. they don't do anything for us.	4
Excellent	5
Great beast, worth for money and especially the finger print touch rockssss.Premium Use.	5
Superb just go for it	5
Another masterpiece by one plus..superb phone..	4
in this review, I m not going to give u any technical details, as the internet is flooded with them, the thing I want to share with you all, is the feeling, yes the feeling!how you feel when you hold this device in your hands!youtube is loaded with tons of videos unboxing one plus 6t, that gives you just an idea about how it looks, but none of it could actually make you feel it until u have it in your hands,i must add, it's like a jewel fabricated with sheer patience and utmost detailing.despite the technical pinnacles that are personified by this device the beauty of it is just hypnotizing.now the question as to whether its worthy to buy it at this price, as we all know the new advancements are being made on a daily basis, well to that, my analysis is, tomorrow it may be overshadowed by any other device, but for today it is the best and yes I own one.	5
Awesome	5
Great phone. Earlier using OP 3T. Once you use OnePlus you won't go for other brand. OnePlus is OnePlus. Night mode looks cool.OS is very smooth. Need some bug fixes.Great battery backup.Fast charging.Very handy.Premium look.Good camera performance.Display is very good.You won't regret if u go for it.	5
Much better than Oneplus 6	5
Awesome phone. Happy with my order	5
If at all there is a flaw in the phone.. I guess it's the default launch and there icons of the app. Few are round, few are square. Hope one plus will fix this soon. Other than that, they messed up the headphone jack. I thought I will get use to it, but after buying this, I miss the headphone jack more n more.. one star less for that	4
Fully impressed with this phone after 1 week of regular usage.This time, it's all about a new InScreen fingerprint sensor and a smaller notchCons:1. Inscreen Fingerprint is Slow.2. Low light Photography not much improvedProns:1. 3700mAh battery Supporting fast charging.2. Screen Size increased by 23%  against the predecessor with a smaller notch3. SUPERFAST FACEUNLOCK which will beat Inscreen fingerprint in unlocking the phone.4. Amazing Built & the device is pretty sleek and is really very fast.5. The camera is excellent.6. Excellent Ram Management.6. No Heating Problem while playing heavy graphics GAMESOverall Rating: 8.5/10 (Rating Deducted due to slow InScreenFingerprint)OnePlus 6T flies along, matching or exceeding rivals.......So Go For It.	5
Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone.	5
Absolutely stunning performance # sexy screen display awesome I loved it.	5
Loved it, I bought OnePlus Six 3 months ago, I Just now purchased the New One Plus 6t and At this price this Phone is par from even any phone in India , I have used Y1 Y2 Note 5 Pro and Even Mi 3s pri e but Now comparison at all, You Will get the worth of your money.	5
Fantastic	5
Superb just go for it...	5
Initial review:Pros:1. Looks amazing2. Superb display with tear drop notch3. Inbuilt call recording feature4. Indisplay fingerprint sensor (but slow and inaccurate sometimes)Cons:1. Average camera quality2. User interface needs more hard work to compete with samsung's interface for eg you cant make folders in apps section. Folders can only be made on homescreen etc3. No wireless charging4. Not complete water and dust proof5. Speaker's loudness is not as good as samsung phones have6. No headphone jack7. No expandable memory8. Midnight black (matte finish at back) not available for 6gb phone9. No ultra wide camera10. No led notification light11. No front flash12. Bit expensiveStill a great value proposition.	4
Bettery is draining very fast and also conpared to one plus 6 bettery where 6 has 3300 mah and last upto 1 day and 6T has 3700 mah and last upto 7 hour. Also volume is auto leveling while using it over bluetooth devices. I would like to exchange with different handset i think i got defective product.	1
There is no notification led... I really don't like the animation in the finger print censor. Expected slimmer phone . But one plus 6t feels heavy !!!	3
Awesome mobile good battery backup nd good camera qualitiSuper perfomensOver all goodFinally iam tell allBlindly go for this mobileBecause ihave 3t mobile alsoLovely mobile 	5
This is the first time I went for a phone from One Plus and I must say it's a good buy.	5
This will blow your mind	5
This phone is lightning fast.My wife's iPhone 6s plus's display looks dull in front of OP 6T.Amoled is seriously magical.I bought this phone because i didn't want to make a mistake by buying a mid range phone like i did last time.Battery lasts more than a day with heavy use.Mirror black color looks so shiny.NOTE :- People who're complaining that their phone is on silent and they're unable to unmute it.thats because of the slide button.Slide that button to bottom.	5
Have been using it for a day. I have used one plus 5t earlier. The camera and performance is increased incredibly!!	5
Go for it. One of the best phone by One plus. 	5
I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!	5
One plus 6T is amazing smartphone and with in-display fingerprint scanner and speedy performance, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notch.Got my One Plus 6T from Amazon on same day delivery when it is available at 12:00 am. Till now i don't found any lag, heating and any battery draining issue so far, supersonic speed, camera clarity in day and night either in indoor or outdoor is amazing.However notification led light is missing which I feel  is most useful feature in every aspect for mobile.One Plus 6T Rocksssss	5
Awesome phone just like OnePlus 6. Feel is great and super smooth. In display finger print is fast you just have to get used to it. SD 845 is a power horse it can handle anything. Battery is also great.	5
Just awesome....Nothing like anything....Speed, design, performance, battery  all extremely speechless	5
It's unexpresable the look, the feel, the performance, battery life, dash charging and so on... Never settlel for less...I am completely fall in love of this killer ...it's definitely one plus to iPhone XS and 2plus to XR...no competition in Android market except Samsung S9/note9 ..but when it come to value for money it's break all the records...just beat the heat ... more review after two day use ....wait and watch...	5
Best in classSmooth OSCamera superbFast delivery by AmazonGreat launch discounts by Amazon and OnePlus	5
Fully satisfied with this product. OnePlus at its best service.	5
Nice product and delivery also superb... I'm very happy with this product.	5
not so many different from 6 but good update. Best segment in price, best display if ur budget under 50k go for it...	5
I HAVE UNLOCKED THE SPEED!!BEST PHONE TILL DATE!!BEAST!!IF U HAVE ONELUS 3,3t ,5,5t IT'S WORTH AN UPGRADE!	5
Not up to the expectation. Too much of hype. Fingerprint scanner is very slow and doesn't work smoothly.I was waiting for it since 2 months, but turned out to be an average phone.	3
Super phone and very fast satisfactory delivery from amazone	5
Phone is superbPrebooked andOne day delivery	5
Kudos to one plus... Best phone ever, camera, display quality, finger print sensor , especially face unlock awesome . Comparing to iPhone 8 one plus 6t is the winner. If you're a android lover then here is the best option.	5
Nice	5
Super Phone... Feels good	5
First time experience with One plus device and I'm happy with the purchase. Fast processing speed, face recognition technology is super quick, on-display finger print scanner is quite fun to use, amazing camera quality (though picture quality in nightscape mode is prone to blurry images if the subject is moving, probably need to test this feature with a tripod for better results).Overall the look and feel of this phone is amazing. Just hold this beauty in your hand and you'll love it.Delivery by E-Mobiles was super quick. Ordered my phone at midnight and it was delivered to me next morning 10 AM !!! Delivered the product as promised in a secured package. Super happy with their fast delivery. Thanks E-Mobiles !!!	5
Thankyouu OnePlus for this amazing phone!	5
Phone is simple awesome with superb battery backup & Cool Camera and ya the best part of the phone is the finger print sensor on screen itself which works superb Go for It Guyzzz	5
Super..Excellent camera..Super fast charging	5
Finger print takes too long to recognize & feel uncomfortable. Otherwise good.	4
As expected complete satisfaction and still a flagship killer, although price could be little competitive having poco F1 in market but still value for money and will feel premium in handPros: 1- Build Quality2 - Nightscape mode pic shared a pic of same3 - Best in class features i.e. 845 processor4 - Android Pie5 - Dash chargerCons:1. Camera could be better, Nightscape mode need stability of hands to click nice photo2. Indisplay fingerprint is not that fast3. Last but not the least headphone jack, OnePlus why you had to remove 3mm port!!!	5
Slow motion camera not clear.Finger print very fast	5
Used for one day . Played heavy games . No lags superfast phone.battery also good.camera upto the mark.	5
Value for money such a good product	5
Only one word awesome, just go and buy, fingerprint scanner is very very fast compared to old scanner. Don't know why people are reviewing fingerprint scanner as slow. It is very fast and accurate too.	5
Pros:Great battery lifeBetter CameraOptimal performanceTop-end designImpressive rear cameraSlider for silent and vibrate modeTiny NotchIn-screen fingerprint sensorLatest OS(Android Pie)Cons:No headphone jackNo microSD card slotNo IP water resistance ratingMore weight, might be because of glass backOverall, the phone is just awesome. Best phone with good performance under this price.Note: Update OS initially to avoid battery drainage problems	5
Wow what a phone!!!!Flagship by one plus.Pros.1. Ultimately battery life. Last one full day.2. Superb camera.3. Drop notch.4. Screen finger print touch sensor. (Pretty fast).5. More screen less bezel.Cons.1. Night mode not as great as expected.2. Same design nd processor as one plus 6.3. Face recognition not as good in dim light conditions.	5
Just Awesome. I would say it is the best Smartphone in the world right now. However price is approximately near to flagship devices. But if you spend money on this smartphone, trust me you will not regret. I have always been a critic, but this smartphone satisfied me with its good camera, amazing battery life, a perfect screen and super fluid performance.	5
Simply amazing	5
As usual OnePlus didn't fail to satisfy the expectations.	5
Unlocked the speed , Great experience Awesome phone .it's worth Thanks :)	5
Good phone	5
Beautiful phone its lighting fast and more beautiful than one plus 6 i love it and thanks amazon for very fast delivery and sound quality and pixels of video are awwwww one word STUNNING lov to be a part of #OneplusFamily	5
It's looking good,. Battery back up superb. It's always one plus rock killer	5
Looks premium and great performance phone on android go for 6gb+128gb affordable	4
This is my first experience with one plus .One plus 6t is pretty impressive. Gud battery backup , finger print scanner is real  quick , display is amazing , camera is mind blowing,......... Now waiting  for the bullet earphones .	5
AWESOME PRODUCT. CAMERA QUALITY IS UNEXPRESSBLE .	5
It's a beast	5
Just awesome	5

ITS Really Faster Than One Plus 6 Too,Very Smooth And Efficient,Under Display Scanner Is Also Quick And The Display Is Really Pretty,One Thing Is For Sure Youll Never Regret Buying A Oneplus Device 	5
Love the product.	5
Phone is awesome camera check display check battery check... There is minor glitch with play store it is pathetic to download a new app as they always shows downloading or download pending.... Hope OnePlus will fix this...	4
Awesome camera and performance. And i like it this phone. I'm happy.Thanks,Amazon and oneplus	5
As name Flagship Killer. Yes it is but overpriced by 4000.Overall good.But it's only two days so can't say too much.	5
Excellent phone !!	5
Ultimate PerformanceUltimate Smart PhoneUltimate Oneplus	5
Good one, optimal performance, good camera, fast and efficient. No 3.5 mm though(Embrace this change buy bluetooth headphones of Bluedio)	5
Got this few days ago & to say flash sales here at amazon are far better than anywhere else. Atleast you have a chance at getting the thing.Inside box:1. Device2. Usb cable3. Charger4. Sim ejector tool5. Few guidesAbout device, as trend goes, MI phones are value for money always. This ones no exception.1. Screen 9/102. Camera 8/103. Battery 9/104. Performance 7/105. Build 8/10Overall 8.2/10********************Pros1. Refreshing looks with round corners2. Good build quality3. AI gimmick (havent tested it much)4. Full screen gestures, yes in pros as i love them in my Redmi note 5 pro & haing them in low end segment is nice5. No hybrid slot, three separate slots, so 2 sim and extra memory at same time6. Dual 4g standby (enable it in settings->sim cards & mobile net)7. Promised upgrade to MIUI 10 & also a major upgrade of Android8. Plethora of sensors (except IR in specific)9.Cons:1. Performance may be a issue if you are coming from 5A. Having both devices right now, can say, this one is a bit on lower side compared to 5A as far as performance is considered.2. No IR blaster in 6A,  i do use it a lot. Its one the key features for me3. Helio vs qualcomm, & it will really matter in this device4. Camera quality, a bit downgraded compared to 5A5. Too many preloaded apps, though you can get rid of max off them (see below)*****************To uninstall preloaded apps & reduce load on device1. Some can directly be uninstalled from settings->installed apps->select app2. Others, which dont have uninstall option, can be uninstalled via adb-Developer mode on (settings->about->tap on miui version 7 times-USB debugging on (settings->additional settings->developer mode-> usb debugging)-On pc, install adb drivers, (or install MI PC Suite)-connect device-command line->adb devices-pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.xyz.abc (where com.xyz.abc is package name)To list all the packages installed "pm list packages". To get into details, use google or search in xda forumsP.S. Proceed with caution as uninstalling any critical package, may produce error & you will be forced to reset the deviceI was able to uninstall around 30+ apks or packages, including duo, gmail, photos, facebook system services app, google plus, play movies, tts, music, print service, spooler, bug report system, email, google quick search box, payment, gallery, talkback, hybrid, emag, live wallpaper, facemoji, weather provider, personal assistant, mipay, mipicks etc etc.After this, phone was a smooth wrt performance as this will clear some storage and ram usage, by reducing background services.****************Dont understand why, Xiaomi took this decision and downgrade a device, with same price bracket, only a screen & camera upgrade is there. They could have kept same qualcomm processor.FINAL VERDICT:If you already have 5A, then 5A to 6A wont be an upgrade though.5A also available at the moment, so you can get 5A instead of this, if you are not so obsessed with round corners of screen and fresh looks. As its a 1 point downgrade as compared to 5A wrt performance & camera.But, if you really want to have a new device & go with current day trend of screen & camera, AI, looks, & can live without IR, its not a bad deal either. It depends on your usage scenario. Refresing device it is.Just some tweaks here and there & it will be good to go.BUT be open to other options available out there, shell out few bucks to avoid cons.	4
Redmi 6A has lag problems. This phone is hanging and lags while using YouTube and browser.Redmi 5A is far better than Redmi 6A. I am regretting on my decision for buying this phone. Not satisfied.	3
Nice phone..	5
Processor is so bad.and not working properly.so please note this point.otherwise redmi 5a processor is so good	1
Don't buy this product. It is not recognizing the second Sim. Its a different and a saperate slot for 2nd sim unlike the other phones  and the phone is not recognizing the 2nd slot. It's better if both the SIM cards are placed in single slot.  Battery backup is very low, you will need to charge twice daily.	1
Too slow go for reminder 5a it's far better than 6a hanging issue	1
Awesome entry level smartphone. Face unlock works a bit slow. But okay. The processor is less power consuming. Full screen display works like charm. A five star for 1.5 day delivery by Amazon. Redmi has lot improved in the music quality section. Pretty decent overall performance. Good choice. Go for it in 6k budget before price rise again.	5
The cameras both front and rear are a huge disappointment as compared to redmi 4 and redmi 5a. I fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. Portrait mode doesn't work properly either. I don't expect the camera of S8 or iPhone in 6000 but other phones in the same price range certainly have better to offer. Other features work well but I was really let down with the camera this time.	3
It's such an amazing budget phone. MI rocks.The display is so good.Sound is awesome.Camera works decent.It has face recognition which works well.Its design is amazing and the weight is so light. There was no lag in the phone.It works perfectly well for normal applications. Video quality is amazing.4g works well.5.45inch screen is big enough it's cool.I'm sure there are still lots of features in this 6k phone!Grab it before the introductory offer is gone, else you will end up paying 7k for same phone.	5
you install and run 2-3 apps together with a small 2gb of ram it can't handle on that ram and the phone literally hangs. Go for Redmi 5a instead. Also the processor is not that much good as compared to Qualcomm. Overall it is not that much good product from redmi	2
I purchased this for my mother who is a first time user of smart phone. MIUI is comfortable. A good budget phone by Xiaomi. It has a good battery life almost 3 days life. Pictures quality is also good at this budget price. A little disappointing Sound quality side since speakers are kept on back side of the phone.	5
I got this set on Sunday Amazon delivery is no doubt awesome phone battery do not looks 3000Mah it discharged in a day without much usage back cam is not great but front cam is good I hate Mi Ui apps it's annoying n full of ads	2
The worst thing on all mi phone is the gyroscopic sensor doesn't work,and personally after 3wk uses of mi6A , battery drain so quickly,face unlock never work properly even you can unlock the phone faster in pattern,better to invest more and go other good brand.	3
Very nice phone.... specially screen is awesome...camera is okay...sound quality is great... Overall for this prise this phone is better option.One thing Mi forgot for this phone is "IR blast"...that is missing.	5
I purchased this mobile on lightning deal. After using few days and updating that Battery life is very worst. Charge is staying for only 4-5 hrs after fully charged even if it is ideal. still i am using only one SIM. if I use dual then not able to imagine the battery life. I guess, Amazon have cheated by offering this kind of deal.	3
Phone is very slow & hanging also. Failed in mi model. Pls don't buy it. Go to another model.	1
Wow Yaar it's looking so good and performance is awesome..Over all good	5
You will Get Dual 4G You Are Looking For. Decent Camera Don't expect Much From A 6k Device.less heat Compared To Previous 5A.You Will Only Feel For The Internal memory.	4
Hi I AM TANVEER AND I AM TELL YOU MI REDMI 6A MOBILE FEATURES AND OTHER CONTAIN  THIS IS VERY USEFUL SMARTPHONE IN LOVEST PRICE . VERY GOOD QUALITY OF SOUND CAMERA SCREEN SPEAKER AS WELL AS 5A .THIS IS NEW SERIES OF MI REDMI  MI 6A.SCREEN QUALITY ETC  THANK YOU FOR YOU READ MY REWIEW	5
Phone specs looks good. But not up the mark. Sound quality is very poor. Redmi 4a was far better. Camera portrait mode works good thanks to The helio processor.	4
ProsEverything......Looking at the price point.ConsNothingIf you want a budget phone with a decent camera, this one is for you......If you are an avid gamer , sorry, not for you bro.....Has killer look and again it is smoooooth.	5
I bought it on 19Sep. All is good except an issue that even my Lift to wake is off, it is gettimg on whenever I pock my phone. This creates lot of issues when I kept my mobile at pocket or when I am in call. Screen automatically gets switched on and mute/end call gets pressed. Amy big fixes?!	2
Nice phone to have , handy and a budget smartphone. Good looking phone with nice features.	5
Great phone at this price rangeYou can't expect more from this price rangeSo just go for itAnd delivered to me 6 days before from expected date	5
Performance is better than other device.. i recommended to buy the Redmi 6A.	4
this device is totally value for money.You cant get better than this in this price segment.	5
Slow ringtone problem bcoz the speaker is in backside.  battery is very powerful. afterall the phone is better then redmi 5a	5
Yas good mobile in India Redmi 6 athis mobile phone purchase efficiency good and very budget phone Indian peoples so like that all people use  phone very good features phone condition and working screen working and almost do Indians like this phone good mobile processor xiaomi redmi 6a	4
True successor of Redmi 5A.Nice product in budget .	5
Internet is very slow, I think, its not 2 GB RAM, It is a 512 MB RAM, other features is good.	3
Good product but processer is not good as Qualcomm processer.	2
Best budget smart phone powerful performance 6A	5
Average product. Go 4 mi 6. Additional 2000 RS but you will get 3 GB RAM, dual camera and finger print sensor.	3
Received the Redmi 6A, as it is promissed in description. Another fantastic output from Xiomi India Plant. Made in India words gives astonishing experience as an Indian.	5
Good one	5
I bought 6a only 1 day ago..battery is too poor.8 hours hold it mobile in 2g network last night data off no other application on..automatically 18 percent down battery.	1
First of all delivery time take a long. display is also this range is good. processor is best not good for gamers to play pubg and GTA Sa. more lagging to play. battery backup to good..Screen ratio is superb in this smartphone and last sounds quality is medium.	4
my suggestion is only that sound speaker should be more powerful as per redmi given its previous every phones. it looks very nice and slim. processor is very fast, good battery life, good nm technology. overall it is the best phone in this price.	4
I am disappointed. I rcvd a faulty charger which is not working. This is cheating and I will NVR recommend anyone to buy this product. PLS HELP REPLACE CHARGER	1
Redmi 6a comes with classy look & light in weight. Camera quality is moderate, comes with lot of installed apps which result 8.44gb vacant space. This mobile is not for those who use social media or heavy usage app bcz it start hanging at very early use.	4
Everything in this phone is good. But I got a faulty phone. The proximity sensor is not working.The Amazon service providers continuously told me lie regarding replacement and return. And now I m just to break the phone. Their lies was highly humiliating.	1
At this price it is best handsetDual 4g volte supportAntutu score about 65kOnly battery backup is little less but it is good for daily use lasted for 24 hous	4
Design is very good.dint find any heating issue after playing game for lang time.Battery life is good.Camera quality is satisfactory.	4
Good smartphone with a very slim design . Performance is good , should have provided a Snapdragon processor instead of mediatek for better performance	5
I am using this mobile since one week so I found so many lags while using youTube, camera, and also battery is draining very fast. The phone look good outside but its is very pure at performance. Please look at alternate mobiles at this price rage.	2
The mobile phone is very good looking for its price and build quality is very nice as well , all features work fine ( have not used the face unlock till now)will update review after long use	4
Not as good as Redmi 5A	3
Good Phone for the price... No finger print scanner makes it slightly off beat. However, looks good and works well too..Only issue I face, is the calls going to "hold" by itself intermittently	4
The sound quality is not upto mark when we take video. Battery and screen quality is good.It has MIUI 9 in it and have upgraded to MIUI 10 at delivery date. Everything was excellent except the delivery partner.I have to collect myself .	4
Mobile is not loaded with anything , but feel like hanging all time .. I guess UI OR software problem	1
Purchased for my father.. he loved it .. especially face unlock . ..  very light weighted... Display sounds good... But camera couldn't satisfy me... Overall it's the most economic deal at 6000	4
Good product with great price. Everything is good.	5
The sound quality is just okk, low volume speaker make hardly audible tone in crowd. Battery is decent with medium usage last for half a day. Screen is not so impressive even it doesn't seems to be 720p display.	3
Excellent Mobile, the look of it is awesome. Metallic body is strong and sturdy.The OS performance is extremely good..	3
Best budget phoneThank you Redmi	5
Sound is very lees in comparison and drains battery fast when using internet. But overall it seems to be good for rs 6000	4
Average mobile in this range but i missing finger unlock feature.	3
This phone is now compare to all products is best phone to budget.  I love this phone Face unlock super,  and now MIUI 10 version software is available now and I am using I love it	5
Price should be less than 5k or tempered glass n case should be in box	4
Its taking around 15 minutes for an app to get installed after downloading.. No issue with the internet connectivity..	2
Hanging at the intial stage without any apps downloaded and worst response from Amazon.  Proximity sensor not working	1
Battery backup not as compare to other redmi mobiles whos contain polymer battery this time li-oin battery not good	4
battery drains from 90% to 5% in 2 hours even if the phone is idle and data swiched off. the problem is with this phone only other wise MI phones have the best battery. Seems like i got a defective item	1
Over all the phone is good but better if quality is increased more like on sound,camera also heating issue is there but can be used	3
Value for money, good product. Made in India	5
I just bought this phone. only 1 week. so far performing good. But I think it cannot match my MI remi 6A which is almost the same price. Battery is dittachable, hence handy, no techy is required	4
Value for enough money,  with this price this is the number one in the market.  Please don't compare with others.  Because it's like it self. Really value for money.	4
Xiaomi products are always up to the mark, similarly this product is also good, having all features. Just fingerprint is missing, otherwise great phone.	4
i am not taken this product delivery boy asked me about opt which is sent on my numberand i want cancle this product ,waiting for great indian festival that is from 10th oct to 14 oct	2
very bad camera	1
Outstanding porfomance it	5

Mobile phone very good but delivery boy behavior very very bad	4

Nice phone in this amount but the phone is very poor performance. Its work too slowly. Also Battery quality is not Better. Good face unlock system and quite faster.	3
Everything was fine but, youtube very slow and sometimes it will test your patience.	4
The speaker is not working properly.  Whenever anyone calls me I can not hear his/her voice clearly. I wanted a replacement but they denied that.	1
Average rating, battery backup is average, camera average, always performance is average	3
Superb	5
Screen is dull while using youtube video. Sound not loud as i want. Fase unlock is ok beacause it can unlock by HD pic I have tried with 22mp image.	3
Simply super mobile on budget segmentSound is clear & loud.Battery life is awesomeScreen quality is good.No heating issue.	5
Its Only 12days of using this Device and it is not able to get charge. really unhappy with this product. This is the first bad experience for me from amazon.	1

hi	3
The phone is looking good for usage and hands on.Lot of pre-installed apps are there in a budget phone, not good for memory.There is dual nano SIM slot with SD card insert option, which is good.For parents or persons, who is just using the phone for speaking and WhatsApp,etc with no multi-tasking ...this is a good option in the current market of September 2018.	5
I got this product on first sale.After using it for three days here is my review.Pros-Good battery life.Nice for video call and light games.Jio is working flawless.Cons-Sound may disturb a bit as volume is low while playing songs but fine in headphones.You can go for it without second thought if you want smart phone under 6k. I am using MI product sience 2014. And satisfied. Yes  screen guard and back cover while buying phone. It will just cost 300 Rs.Hit like if you find it useful.	5
Model 8/10Screen 9/10Battery 6/10Camera 7/10ROM should be 32 GB  as 16 GB is very low, I am using external 64 GB card because 75% space is used to install apps. only 25% of internal memory is available for storage.this phone may useful for beginner.	4
My expectations were huge when i ordered the Redmi 6A. But when i got the product it was a defective one. The second slim slot was not accepting SIM. I Initiated the return and it was very fast, good service by amazon. But still quality checks of products should be done accurately to avoid such issues.	1
YouTube and other videos are very dull... It's not worth 6000/-.	2
Wow what a phone redmi 6A is...  Very nice display,  light weight single hand use awesome feeling in hand, great battery backup thanks to 12 nm technology,  nice processor.  Good camera.  AI face unlock Only xiaomi can make incredible phone like this... I have used lot of phones till date but this phone is different, beautiful, easy to use, good built quality, this phone is smooth like butter. Thanks Xiaomi for this great device at a very low price.	5
Nice Budget phone.Screen quality - HD+Storage - Not up to mark, can expect so better to use SD cards.Dedicated SD card slot is good.Camera is as usual as other redmi phone have.This phone is not for those who like to play game in mobile.Overall 7 out of 10	3
Look beautiful	4
Nice phone under 6000rs	5
Its slightly slow,2gb ram is not sufficient.you get only 8gb out of 16 gb.sound quality is not good.Display is decent because it is not fhd only hd+.Can't say about battery backup, i will update later.5k is enough for this phone, Redmi is looting 1k/ phone because of it's brand value in India.Look is not so much attractive.You can get more better phone in this price range.	2
Don't waste your money, the processor is supper slow and will take ages to load.Waste of Money!!! Nice experiment in budgeted category by REDMI; however, it has broken the trust I had :(	1
Redmi 6a comes with classy look & light in wiight. Camera quality is moderate, comes with lot of installed apps which result 8.44gb vacant space. This mobile is not for those who use social media or heavy usage app bcz it start hanging at very early use. Acc to me..redmi 5a is much better than 6a.	3
Called to return this device but the only replace it but I can't get a refund.Don't buy this phone if you need decent speed.This phone is too slow and camera quality is so cheap for 6000.3500 would justify the money.	1
Got it in first sale. Definitely a worthy upgrade of Redmi 5A. Looks way modern than its predecessor. Compact, light weight, beautiful. The display is gorgeous, processing speed is higher than 5A.The camera is decent. Most important thing about this phone is you are getting all things in a very low budget. Those who are looking for a decent 4G phone, you can't get better than this. 3GB ram variant would be much needed.	5
I like so much	5
Awesome phone in  6000pros1 large screen and good display2 face unlock3 good processor4 no lag5 google assistant is working fine6 Dual 4g7 Light weightcons1 camera is not that good as i expected as i also have samsung on 5 and the focus of on5 camera is far better than 6Ait is difficult to focus on object like flowers etc,because of focus image becomes blurry2 sometimes faceunlock may not workoverall its good phone in this budget	4
Sound is not that much good	3
Gud phne...only issue is internl memomry(8gb avialable ny fr use in 16gb phne) nd 2gb ram...	5
I recieved the mobile after 5days. The mediatek processor is very slow while opening the apps it takes ages to open while battery is disgusting while compring 6a to 5a is far better. 5a contains sd425 is far better while opening the youtube it takes time to open while at th booting it takes to restart the phone. It is worst exprience with phone.	1
I was using redmi 5a which is really great .I have purchased it because i want dual volte at lower price but at this time redmi disappointed me because it has no fingerprint again and also IR BLASTER missing which is in redmi 5a .helio p22 is not so good as i tried to run pubgm in low graphics settings but it still hangs and i m not satisfied with camera quality as it's exposure is not good compared to redmi 5a otherwise it is same as redmi 5a .i have purchased it only due to dual volte	3
Advantages-Compact size3 slote (2sim volte + micro sd)Great photographyLow light condition is okVery bright flash lightFast Face lockLoud SoundLot of Sensors (double tap,hold and more gesture)Disadvantages-Only 2 gb ramLots of extra apps pre install	5
Excellent just loved it...	5
Redmi 6a phone is very good in this price and face unlock is best feature in this mobile.	5
At this price ,redmi done awesome job 13 MP rear camera3000 mAh battery13.8 cm HD+ Display2GB RAM16 GB ROMnano sim card + nano sim card +expandable micro SD card slot (both 4g/volte )Micro USB chargerUser guide manualSim card eject pin(No earphone)	5
The best smartphone under 6000 rupees budget anyone can buy. Although internal space is a bit low but you can pop in an SD card also, so overall the phone feels lightweight and comfortable to hold. I would recommend this under 6K budget with decent specs and looks.	5
Mi always rocks With New launch of model. We just received this product Checked Config and compared with 5a its good. We selected 2 Day delivery and Received Today morning 10 Am. Amazon is so fast now days.	5
At this price range this is best smartphone option available. When we compare it with 5A , 6A has bigger screen, face unlockand better display quality. While 6A has 2Ghz quadcore Mediatek Helio A22 processor, 5A has 1.4 Ghz quadcore snapdragon 425 processor , that means 6A has latest processor, but I have seen some YT videos stating that 5A has better performance than 6A. Best feature of this device I liked is it has active 4G on both SIM cards. Face id takes little time to unlock phone but its fine at this price range. Must buy. You won't get any other phone at this price range with these feature.	4
Very good mi 6A mobile phones very low price only 5999 2gb 16gb 5.45 display hd+ love you Amazon and mi	5
Nice phone at this price..	5
I m using this mobile since 5 days...We can see the everything separately...Battery: battery backup is too good as mi phones are well known for thisCamera: camera seems perfect as per the price of this phoneProcessor:mediatek A22 processor is not that good as Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that is used in redmi 5A...but it's fine...you won't see any laggingRAM:you will get only 700-800mb to use because there is total of 2gb ram available...you can't expect smooth high graphics gaming environment...best for other uses	5
mind blow super	5
One day delivery was awesome. Storage available for usage is only around 8gb. Need to buy memory card. Price should be between 5 and 5.5k only. Not worth 6k. Feedback about battery and performance I will update after usage only.	3
Received on 26th September-18, started function on 28th after placing new nano SIM, but it's suddenly stopped working from 7th morning. Trying to contact local MI service centre but it closed.	5
The phone is looking good for usage and hands on.Lot of pre-installed apps are there in a budget phone, not good for memory.There is dual nano SIM slot with SD card insert option, which is good.For parents or persons, who is just using the phone for speaking and WhatsApp,etc with no multi-tasking ...this is a good option in the current market of September 2018.	5
Phone is good but video quality is not good ..when you see  YouTube ,Facebook video is not perfect play ..poor quality seen	3
Pro:-A big screen.Cons:-1.Bad sound quality.2.Hangs while using YouTube.3.Hangs using apps simultaneously.4.Cameras 13MP/5MP works mysteriously low as compared to other phones of same specs.5. The processor sucks.6. You only get 8GB storage.The phone shouldn't have costed more than 5000.Seems xaomi will end up very soon.	2
Dont run behind expensive Nokia one plus moto Vivo. They are just making fool to customer. Think jan Nokia 6 launch Rs. 18000 then after 3 month Nokia 6.1 launch Rs. 19000 then just after 3 month Nokia 6.1 plus launch 16000.  It means company overprices its every launch. Latest model is cheaper then earlier with added feature how it is possible.So I request all smartphone buyers do not buy smartphone higher then 10000.	5
NyC LoOkINg NyC Features	5
Overall good quality, the camera is nice, the voice over call is cool, AI unlock works most of the time, Speaker is not that satisfactory, but what else you need at such price.. I aint a gamer,, so this is good for me... Also,, space issue is there,, available memory is less....consider buying a memory card....	5
Superb product with Super Price...Redmi 6AI am also Redmi Note5pro UserRedmi is always Number 1No words to say about my happiness....Love you Soo much Xiaomi...	5
Amazing quality ...Redmi done a good job...	5
Mobile is so good. Every thing is nice. Value of money.	5
best phone in this budget, bought for my Mom, she is happy with it, big screen with small form factor.good if not best camera, good sound quality from audio jack.	4
My device face enroll option is not show	1
I love it.	5
The mobile is perfect based on battery, camera, screen resolution as well as dedicated card slot and dual 4G. Just no IR blaster present, so no remote, that's the only flaw.	5
Phone was great and it is bigger than Redmi 5a and camera quality was also good but packing was so not good but other was good ? It is 16gb internal and2gb ram ?	5
Nice	1
in this budget you are getting best mobile phone having face lock same feature as my MI MAX 2 having little functions like MI Remote is missing in this camera is good, overall perfect phone in this price	5
Awesome phone under 7k*Good camera*Good screen*Good sound clarity*Good battery	4
This phone is just amazing I sugest to buy it in this budget it is best phone under 6K	5
Front and back camera is good.But screen resolution is not good.	4
Guys its a budget phone,never expect more from it,for regular and normal use its better in the market in this price range.Seems good after few days usage..Battery back up ok for 1.5days.Screen resolution not fhd but ok...good for eye.Processor not for gamers.You need to buy a memory card for it.Both Camera good for this price.Sound not so loud but clear.U can delete pre-installed unnecessary apps to clear the ram and make the phone fast.Dual nano sim 4G support and 256GB expandable memory feature is best Point of this phone.For budget phone users go for it....	4
am used this brand from 3 years ago but this handset is totally worthless product	1
awesome phone.. in 6k.. black look is great..	5
got the phone at 9am, Looks good in hand, But disappointed only 7.83 GB Available out of 16 GB Which is very less, face unlock works Good, tried with photo not unlocked, But i took my photo in my friend's vivo 20mp camera and tried unlocked many times, this is very sad i am using PIN now, display under  sunlight OK with full brightness, Camera pictures good, bot front and rear, price should be 5000, not 6000 Redmi made name and looting now. will update about battery and performance after two days,	3
Best budget phone in this price	5
I will not demand anything more for just Rs.6000. Fully Satisfied.	5

Youtube app video dont play a good picture quality...rest all well in this price range	3
Bought this on the very 1st sale and i am impressed.Keeping in mind the price i would say that the mobile is amazing.U get dual sim 4g and a memory card slot.Basic apps run well on the 2gb ram. Camera is decent as well. And the display is good enough. And the face unlock works(it is a bit slow although).The only drawbacks are:No fingerprint sensor and ir blaster.The device volume could have been a bit higher.Overall ghe the best mobile for 6k	5
Not a great phone but cannot expect more than anything for this price. Poor camera quality and battery life is also not good. We cannot take the pics at night and this will work at day time some extent. Sound quality is not bad but not up to the marak. Screen resolution is not good.If someone is looking for Android phone for calling purpose go for it. For other purpose like gaming and watching videos and browsing choose other good RAM phone.Display-6/10Design-6/10Camera-5/10Sound-6/10Battery-4/10Price -8/10	3
This smartphone has a hardware issue. It's second sim slot is not working. I am sure that I  have only got the defective product or not. I opted for replacement. I do not expect a smartphone manufacturer such as Xiaomi which has poor quality checkup standards. I am hoping to get working smart after replacement.	1
Fantastic product in terms of body, looks, battery etc. The part which misses the rating is the buggy software which brings the hardware to life. Its the security bug which locks repeatedly though you enter correct pin or pattern; especially more observed when dual space is enabled. Mi website also lists the issue in so many threads. Go for a Google search of "Phone Has been locked, Try Again in 119 minutes" and verify yourself. Its all about the bug in several of the mi product, and personally faced many times. Imagine you have to call a Uber  or Ola cab to catch a flight and you get the message. Other issue is heating, which is prominent in hot weather. Be careful if you are in Delhi or Gujarat during summer.  Otherwise phone is good in this budget.	2
The phone is too slow. Please don't go for this. Despite of having 2GB RAM, Phone lags too much.And you will get unnecessary ads by Xiaomi. Which gets really annoying sometimes.	1
Cheap and best compare to all other brand products....	5
Bought this phone for my dad, and he uses it for just Whatsap and Youtube. Even though battery is just 3000mah, phone can be used for the entire day with a single charge. Only con is its plastic body. Other than that, this is a good buy for avg users in this price range.	5
Slightly lagging with normal use Xaiomi worst decision to go for Helio A22 better go with redmi 6 with some more penny...deserve 10 of 6 to this phone	4
Picture quality is not so good. You will get to know this when u watch a YouTube vedio even in 360p .Regarding sound I would say average . You will get to know this when u play a song in loudspeaker.Battery is above average.	5
Really budget smartphone.....	5

Hi Guys today i am writing a review about Redmi 6A. This is an entry-level smartphone that got the basics right.First of all best thing is that i got that phone in first sale that is osm. I ordered that for my dad. i am using redmi note 5 pro which is amazing. i got the base version with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage for Rs 5,999 in black colour.Firstly let me explain the specification of the Redmi 6A:- It comes with dual sim also that it has extra slot for memory card too, which is amazing mostly all others phones comes with hybrid those are just comes with two slot where u can add two sim or one sim and one memory card , So this is best option in this phone.- That comes with oreo update (8.1) that is great also the mi user interface update is MIUI 9.0. They promised the MIUI 10 update soon.- There is 13MP Back camera and 5MP Front facing son.- It comes with 5.4 inches screen with an aspect ratio of 18:9- I purchase the model 2GB Ram and 16GB Internal memory. we can extend the memory to 256GB with microSD card- That comes with Quad-core 2.0 GHz.- The Battery is 3000 mah that is non-removableIn a Box:In a box i get Redmi 6A phone, Adapter and One Usb Cable. There is little disadvantage to buy that redmi phone is that they didnt give the headphones with the mobile that is major drawbacks but the features they are providing in this price range is best.So today i just received the phone and that is just unboxing. so i will update my review as per my eperience with this phone after one month and update so on.In the first phase and first day this is my first experience of this phone Redmi-6A, soon i will update my review as per my experience.So, Overall my experience of today this phone is that it has a pretty good deal if you searching for better smartphone with low price then i must say that this is best deal as per my opinion right now.	4
Never expected this from Xiaomi. I have Redmi 2 Prime which is far better than this phone. Redmi 6A is very very slow, video quality not good, camera not good, keyboard appear very slow when finding a contact to call, lot of ghosting when moving the camera in the room for focus. I just used it for half a day and repacked it and put it in shelf. Again switched back to my Moto G4 play. Not sure if Amazon take the return but I will try to return it. Don't buy this phone. My sincere advice.Update: I was able to return my phone. They said they can't return money but will send a replacement. And then again said since they don't have stock so returned the amount itself.	1
Received the phone today.Packing was good.Phone is good.Considering the budget it's a nice phone with excellent features.It won't disappoint you but keep in mind that it's a budget smart phone.Face unlocking works fine.fingerprint unlock is a missing factor which must be noticed.For someone looking for a base model smartphone it's a good option.As we all know redmi won't disappoint us.I think the face unlock was needless in this one and fingerprint would have been the better option.Anyways it's a value for money model.	4
Even though it is a brand new phone it started showing lag and keeps hanging while using... Will not recommend buying it....	1
Ordered in a minute when deal was opened. Within 3 minutes all sold out. But luckily I got one.On the features of the mobile its really out of the level. Never expected such a featuristic mobile for such price.Been using iPhone as well. Most of the features available in iPhone are available in this mobile also.Finally really worth for money. Do buy only from Cloud Tail.Certified Seller 	5
EVERYTHING  IS GOOD But disappointed only 7.83 GB Available out of 16 GB Which is very less, face unlock works Well, tried with photo not unlocked.	4

The phone which I purchased through amazon is a worst, I cannot trust amazon anymore, I purchased Redmi 6A on 12th of Nov. I own the phone tried using it, since its a dual sim, I inserted my two sim, n tried using,the second sim was not detectable, I took out again n tried inserting again,the same thing was showing on, I took the new phone to a mobile shop to show it, den the shopkeeper said the motherboard is not good, so funny the new phone which I purchased was from amazon redmi 6A,is not a good phone, I have kept the phone to change the mother board..worst experience ever...	1
Phone is worth. Only battery mh is i think low. Now not a problem in future Batery one days full use or not i don't know	4

One of the best phones in between these months. Battery life is very good, sound quality is perfect and picture quality is too good. Also it is not heating ;that's the best thing I liked a lot.Totally a perfect phone in a suitable budget for Indian people.In a single word for saying about this phone is COMPLETE PERFECT.The bill sent by  Amazon or the seller is not very good quality so that in a damaging situation within warranty period may create difficulty. This is the one thing that I haven't get any answer yet.For this reason I don't give full rating.I am giving two opinions about the phone & the warranty or payment bill of this product from my own experience. Choice is Yours.	4

Love the phone. Everything on it works as expected.  I've been using this phone for about 1 weeks, and so far I'm loving it. Here's me breakdown:The quality, fit and finish are amazing. No one believes this is low priced phone.Battery: exceptional battery life, the best in any smartphone I've had so far.Build/design: one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I've used, even compared to much more expensive models.Camera: not as good as my Honor 7C, but still takes good enough pictures that it's not really a problem for me.Really littil bit difficult to find fault with this phone, especially for the price even I don't like the audio quality. overall Best Product. Durable solid feel, very responsive and works great overall.	4

During the call without headset, the display is not getting off so that, it resulting to adding another call and sometime hold the current calls without knowledge.While speaking the display should off to avoid such issues where proximity sensor is not functioning in the mobile, when check with customer care they are asking to format all the data's and handover the mobile to them for software update..., very much disappointed.., why cant we should have update directly from MI	1

Best product at this price...	5
pros :1. it's stand by time is amazing2. screen quality is good although not clearly visible in direct sunlight3. dual 4g works like a charm4. back camera is decent, good for the price5. it has dedicated micro SD card slot so memory is not a problemcons :1. screen on time is bad redmi y2 also has a 3000 mah battery but it's battery life is far better than this2. front camera is not good in low light3. the speaker is terrible. it's on the back and it's not very loud so many times I missed calls.4. I don't know if xiaomi will deliver regular security updatesVerdictIt's definitely a good phone for it's price also i just saw it's price increased 600 rupees so i would say if battery life is your highest priority and you can spend extra 1400 go for the realme c1.

I had recently purchased MI 6A phone. But after 3 days of the purchase the phone started giving issues on the call quality. While the call is going on suddenly there is a drop of the voice where either side cannot hear each other. I did not expect this with MI phones as previous versions have been quite stable.This is unfortunate that the date of return is gone and now only the repair center will be doing the rest by taking another 15 days to fix the same.	1

So very good	5
Nice mobile	5
What one could expect for a 6k price . If someone wants a phone within 6k segment this is the best. Go for it but do not expect much.	4
Its best for moderate users. Perfect in budget and much better performance at this price of 5999. It has nice design and looks nice.  It is light weight, slim and battery easily lasts for one day. Camera quality is not best but it's good and give clear shots. Getting dual 4g at this price is awesome thing. Screen display is best. Only thing I found bad was a little bit lagging while using heavy apps or games otherwise best option for normal users who don't use heavy apps or games (like pubg. Its lags a little even with minimum pixels). On looking the price tags it's best at 6k price range.	4
I like likethis price segment phone at the brand. But this time not for sure is this value for money.	4

Picture quality and battery life are far better than the other products in this price range. Super satisfied with this.Xiaomi Mobile's never disappoint you.  	5

I have used my LYF-Flame-1 earphone with Redmi 6A, sound quality in earphone is loud, clear. But Remi 6A's speaker volume is not that good. It's average.Face unlock ~ I have not tested yetJio & Airtel SIMs are working fineWith Jio Recharge 198/- on Redmi 6A, I have received additional 10 gb data as promised by Redmi.Overall, good phone. For camera please install a better app, Battery is non-removable and SIM Card ejector requires ejector pin so it makes it little difficult for them who experiment with phone a lot.MRP on the box was 6,999/-On Amazon sale, I have purchased it at 5,999/-.At this price, it's a perfect deal. Go for it.	5

Very good	4
The features on offer are overwhelming and best in class for the price.Purchased this phone for my mom and she is very happy.Here are some (cons) that might put you off from buying this phone:1.No display protection like gorilla glass.2.Comes with hybrid SIM slot. So you cant use both SIM cards and microSD card at the same time.3.Fingerprint & Gyro sensors are missing.4.No 4000mah battery, it's 3000 mah this time.	5

i got what i expected no over heating , Getting 36 hours battery back up with usage of you tube, news, voice sometimes, and without whats app.  Out of 2GB, 950 MB left for free which is sufficient for normal users. 8GB ROM free. Loaded apps are MS Office apps, all google, Mi apps security, cleaner, drop, video, store, community, Other apps, amazon, facebook, phonepe, netflix, dailyhunt, share chat, opera. Updates to MUIU 10, Charging takes 3 hrs.Pros. Two sides mic, Very good touch, Good camara's, No lag, Separate slot for Mem card.Cons: No gorilla glass, No front flash but blur effect on back view. Ring is avg loud. Indoors good, but outdoors we should concentrate.	5

Camera is descent Very good mobile phone in 6000 price range there are also other phone in this range but guys go for this one trust me MI mobile are very good ...they are giving overall package means other phone either they will give good quality camera ,battery, design etc  for e.g. oppo and Vivo mobile there camera are good but overall I dont like they are putting hell lot of money on advertisements and not on product ...but if you go for mi they are near to perfection in giving value for money... I really trust this brand according to me they are new SAMSUNG  the way they we used to trust this brand for smart phone e.g. galaxy y series but now they are lagging behindThis what I feel first phone which I order was mi 4i for my sister which she used almost three years without any issues then boom my whole family mi productMi 4i , Redmi 3s, note 3,note 4, Redmi 4, Redmi y2,Redmi 5a ,Redmi 6a trust me till now none of mi product has disappointed us ....Redmi 6a is very decent phone for parentsIf you found my review helpfulPlease give helpful vote	4

The product is very good but the battery life and the processor is very poor if you have a low budget and you want to buy something very normal or good thing so this is so this product is very perfect for that requirement the camera quality is awesome but the vibration is not very good and the xiaomi keyboard is a very bad whenever I use Google keyboard Sonic keyboard replace it on Google so that's a bad thing about I see in this phone and yesterday I buy this phone and the day after tomorrow the phone is not working properly is this display is not working well so finally I restart and reboot and wipe all the data from this phone and then its fun working properly and charger cable is very the data cable is very low very small	3

Great phone at this price truly	5
Redmi 6a is good product. But 2gb ram is less for smooth functioning. Picture and sound quality is best but battery is average.  It's only 6-7 hours battery life if you charge fully then. You get MIUI 10 in redmi 6a. In camera you got portrait mode for selfies. Rear camera quality is too good. But it's work on mediatek this is it's minus point. Screen 5.5 inches. All over I like this phone.	4

worst product from MI	1
Product is as expected to be. BTW my first order was cancelled claiming it was damaged and returned to the seller from my city without reaching to me and without confirmation. Refund process went normal. This time it got delivered just next day of placing the order. Handset is worth in this price for average use. Don't expect high end gaming. Best as a gift for parents if they are still using JAVA phone. I also bought this for my parents. Satisfied.	4

After 4 days use I discovered that the battery performance is poor and voice quality is not so good. Also mi logo at back case was faded.

Nyc mobile	5
Xiaomi has completely messed up the redmi 6 series with mediatek chipsets.I am a big fan of xiaomi and used to recommend xiaomi phones for all right from redmi note 3 times but Xiaomi isn't good these days. Mediatek chipset seems better only on paper, in real world performance even 1.5 yr old redmi 4A can easily beat it.Though rear camera quality has improved , selfie camera performance is disappointing.Battery life is no way close to the Redmi 4A or 5A. And the ram management,real world performance feels completely worst .Worst xiaomi phone ever.Now the under 7k market is filled with better devices like powerful Realme c1 , feature rich lenovo A5 and snappy Asus max lite so be wise to choose a good phone.Even redmi 5A is far better choice than this.Wish things get improved with Miui updates.	3
Sound is worst. You can't understand whether your phone is s ringing or not at max volume also. Ring volume is worst	1

Super mobile on this prise	5
Camera is not Good it doesn't have image stabilizer.	4
Honestly speaking, this was my first Xiaomi device that I bought from Amazon. And I'm not disappointed at all. The battery life is good, the screen quality is good and the sound quality is good as well. The only problem is that the speaker is backfacing, so if the phone is kept with screen upwards, then any sound, specially call ringtone, won't be heard at all. Even at the highest volume. The phone is good at this price. Decent performance. The camera is good as well. For a person who is looking for a first smartphone, go for it. But beware of bloatware. It might annoy you.Thank You.	4

I bought this phone for my mom but I thought I should test it as my primary device for few days. After few days of usage here are first impressions of this budget phone: Build Quality (8/10): It has a solid plastic build. It has rear curves slightly towards the edges which gives good grip on phone so don't worry about slipping phone from your hand. Camera (9/10): 13 MP rear camera takes decent shots in daylight. The front camera is 5 MP with portrait mode feature which works on AI which does fairly good job. So selfie camera in general takes decent photos with beauty mode. Display(8.5/10) : It has 5.4 inches hd LCD display with 18:9 aspect ratio which makes less bezels. Viewing angles are not that good but acceptable for two peoples. It performs average in sunlight keeping in mind its price. Performance(7/10): This phone comes with Helio A22 chipset with 2 GB ram. Phone comes with so many pre loaded apps which you can disable. This phone sucks in multitasking. You can play small games on it. Xiaomi will improve it's performance with MIUI 10 update.(MIUI 10 Beta is already out and works fantastic) Battery(9/10): It has decent 3000 mAh battery which gives you whole day power for moderate usage.Other specifications which are impressive at this price:1. AI face unlock2. Dual VOLTE3. Dual sim slot + memory card slotCons:No fingerprint scanner  Overall rating : 8.5/10  With such a low price tag it is best mobile in the market. You can definitely buy it. Recommended.  If you find this helpful, don't forget to press helpful button.	4

The phone is very nice and the build quality is also good and it has a nice display and a good speaker in this price range in performance wise the phone is good for normal users like surfing and it is good for casual gaming but comes to heavy games like pubg etc the phone sucks the phone is not good for gaming it really sucks go for real me c1 adding 1000 buck don't buy it for the user's who do heavy games in their phone but the other wise for common users it is a good phone no lags in surfing in internet etc it is really a good choice for common people BUT IF YOU ARE GAMER DONT BUY IT REALLY SUCKS !!! go for real me C1 it's will give u decent performance in this price range	3
Not at all happy.  Poor sound quality.  When phone rings back cover Virabets.  My redmi 2 was 100 times better than this.	2

This is a good smartphone under 7k budget and if you are going through a tight budget you should go for it.	4
This product is very good in this prizeThanks for mi and Amazon	4
Superb!!!!Good built, phone feels solid in hand. Battery easily lasts more than 24hrs under moderate usage including gaming.I love the camera with full manual control, front portrait, advance beauty mode etc.Tap to focus is fast, so is the auto focus in vedeo mode. HRD takes milli seconds to capture. Huge improvement in camera department.It can hold two sims with micro sd card at a time since it has dedicated triple slot. Supports dual 4g.Sadly there is no finger sensor, face unlock is present and is software based.	4
Awesome Product at this price range. It has very good quality of camera and very good battery life. I use this product past 4 days and I fully satisfied.	5

Was giving a thought on buying the real me c1, but passed it on since the OS in real me sucks big time as its mostly unpolished. So this was the 2nd best option after that.Pros:Good Battery life.Dual 4g support.Design wise its easy to operate, poly carbonated body ensures the durability but placement of speakers could have been at the bottom.User interface, though noticed some hiccups, nothing an update can't solve.A better Chip than SD425.Light weight.Display is good for the pricing.Cons:Removal of the IR blaster.Average Camera, though didn't have high hopes for it as per the pricing.Additional apps or bloatware, if you know how to deal with them, it shouldn't be the case.	4

Overall a perfect smartphone in this budget. Camera is the biggest positive in the phone. Thought it doesn't have dual camera the quality vof picture is amazing. Selfie camera is also great and has portrait mode which works amazing.2 GB ram is sufficient in this segment though you would feel 16 GB (8.4 GB usable) is less storage space.Built quality is good. Screen quality is also nice and can play HD videos.Overall the best phone in this range.	5

I didnt get ear phones	1
I bought this phone on Sep 19th, got it on 20th.Phone is a good one at this price point. No doubt in that. There are few things Amazon can do to better @.1. Make all colour options available.2. As part of the Great Indian Sale free screen replacement/insurance is provided. It would be better if the same is provided for all other customers who had bought the same phone within the last month period. It feels like I was deprived of the offer just because I bought the phone earlier, though at the same cost.Could not think of better place to mention this than this review.	4

For the price tag it's a great buy. This is indeed a good smartphone. A phone for the parents.Build quality is awesome. MIUI 10 packs tons of features, and looks very modern.

Good phone 6k face camera very bad quality	4
First time disappointed with redmi. NOT SURE WHY THEY GO LIKE SAMSUNG, the processor is a gimmik  Redmi used to create a wow effect in budget phones, but this time its just you get what you pay. Extend your budget and go for something good. The phone is utter slow, color reproduction is not upto mark. Youtube videos are pathetic. Redmi 4A was even better.	3
Bought it for my mom. The screen is okay for the price. Face unlock is great. A bit on the slower side. Overall an acceptable phone for 6k. Nothing mind blowing about this phone.	4
Music could have been better.. In the sense that at the bottom the speakers should have been there... Otherwise good	3
